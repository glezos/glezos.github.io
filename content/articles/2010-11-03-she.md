A poem about that girl I met yesterday.

>...she  had  an unusual calmness around
><br/> her. One,  that  everyone  strives  for.  The
><br/> calmness  of  a floating kite. That character
><br/> of a river.   Calmness  which,  monks  attain
><br/> through divine realisation, and turtles gain,
><br/> perhaps, through years  of  watching  genera-
><br/> tions  pass  by.  I  found it soothing like a
><br/> river; So tender, yet extremely  captivating.
><br/> Her low voice, quiet smile, all had an excep-
><br/> tional gracefulness to it. I never  told  her
><br/> all  this;  Actually, I couldnâ€™t. And today I
><br/> think, some things are just meant not  to  be
><br/> conveyed;  They are meant to become memories,
><br/> and we are suppose to cherish  them  for  the
><br/> eternity.
