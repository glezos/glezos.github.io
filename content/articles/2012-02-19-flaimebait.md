The reason you have arived here is probably due to the fact that the owner of this web site has deemed some portion of a comment as flamebait.

While I am not sure of many things, here are a few things I do believe:

- Overall, the comments feature of my weblog is something that I find the most enjoyable and rewarding aspects of my site.
- I welcome thoughtful and respectful expressions of alternate points of view.
- There are some topics that I am interested in that others seem to find as irresistable temptations to bash one another.
- Nobody has an inalienable right to place information on my website.  If you have something to say, I encourage you to get your own weblog.  Feel free to use trackback to draw attention to your comments.

Given the above, I would like to find a solution less drastic than disabling comments, blocking of ip address, or wholesale removal of comments. That being said, I do reserve the right to selectively employ one or more of the above in situations I feel warrant it.

At the moment, the best solution I have come up with is to mark up the portions I find objectionable with links to this page. No words are addded, deleted, or rearranged in the process.

Suggestions are welcome.
