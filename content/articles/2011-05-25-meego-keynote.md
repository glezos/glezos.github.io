I had the privilege to be invited to the opening keynote talk at the recent MeeGo Conference in San Francisco. Jim Zemlin, the Director of Linux Foundation, called me on stage to talk about MeeGo Localization and the acceleration of MeeGo's availability in dozens of markets around the world we achieved with Transifex.
