Steak au poivre with smoked sweet potato chipotle puree, roasted tomato and portobello mushroom.

#### Execution

Lots of good recipes for "[steak au poivre](https://www.google.com/search?q=steak+au+poivre)". Many small details make all the difference. My sauce has shallots, beef stock, cognique, heavy cream and a little butter. There's a sprinkle of crispy bacon at the top.

For the puree, I boiled the sweet potatoes and then grilled them in the oven until a bit blackened to add a smoky flavor. I pur√©ed them in a food processor with some hot chipotle sauce, milk, butter and heavy cream.

The tomato and portobello mushroom slice were marinated with spicy balsamic vinaigrette and then grilled.
