A lot of friends abroad ask me the same question: "What has led up to the current financially hard situation in Greece?". I found this excellent article from NY Times called "[Can Greeks Become Germans?](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/opinion/20friedman.html?_r=1)", which summarizes the problem in a very detailed way. I'll quote some large sections here, for reference.

> [...] Germany is the epitome of a country that made itself rich by making stuff.
> Greece, alas, after it joined the European Union in 1981, actually became
> just another Middle East petro-state — only instead of an oil well, it had
> Brussels, which steadily pumped out subsidies, aid and euros with low
> interest rates to Athens.

> Natural resources create corruption, as groups compete for who controls the
> tap. That is exactly what happened in Greece when it got access to huge
> Euro-loans and subsidies. **The natural entrepreneurship of Greeks was
> channeled in the wrong direction — in a competition for government funds and
> contracts.** To be sure, it wasn’t all squandered. Greece had a real
> modernization spurt in the 1990s. But after 2002, it put its feet up,
> thinking it had arrived, and too much “Euro-oil” from the European Union went
> back to financing a corrupt, patrimonial system whereby politicians dispensed
> government jobs and projects to localities in return for votes. This
> reinforced a huge welfare state, where young people dreamed of a cushy
> government job and everyone from cabdrivers to truckers to pharmacists to
> lawyers was allowed to erect barriers to entry that artificially inflated
> prices.

> European Union membership “was a big opportunity for development, and we
> wasted it,” explained Dimitris Bourantas, a professor of management at Athens
> University. “We also did not take advantage of the markets of the [formerly]
> socialist countries around Greece. And we also did not take advantage of the
> growth of the global economy. We lost them all because **the political system
> was focused on growing public administration — not on [fostering]
> entrepreneurship, competition or industrial strategy or competitive
> advantages**. We created a state with big inefficiencies, corruption and a very
> large bureaucracy. We were the last Soviet country in Europe.”

> That is why, he added, that **Greeks, when they move to the U.S., “unleash
> their skills and entrepreneurship**” in ways that enable them to thrive in
> commerce. But here in Greece, the system encourages just the opposite.
> Investors here tell you that the red tape involved in starting a new business
> is overwhelming. It’s crazy; Greece is the only country in the world where
> Greeks don’t behave like Greeks. Their welfare state, financed by Euro-oil,
> has bred it out of them.

> With the decline of Beirut and Dubai, Athens should have become the service
> center of the Eastern Mediterranean. Instead, Cyprus and Istanbul seized that
> role. Greece must not waste this crisis. While it has instituted some reforms
> in the last year, Prime Minister George Papandreou said to me, “**What is most
> frustrating is the resistance in the system. How do you produce a change in
> culture?**”

> It will take a cultural revolution. And that can happen only if Greece’s two
> major parties come together, hold hands, and collectively force through a
> radical change in the governing culture from the top down. Without that,
> Greece will never be able to pay back its loans.

**Update 6 Mar 2012:** Following my [respectful discource](http://miniblog.glezos.com/post/17906591407/flaimebait) policy, I've annotated some flamebait parts of the comments on this thread. I don't like removing comments or moderating, so I chose to annotate and link to the relevant post where further information and discussion can take place.
