> His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide<br/>
for his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br/>
turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br/>
and whistles in his sound.
> 
> Last scene of all<br/>
that ends this strange eventful history<br/>
is second childishness and mere oblivion;<br/>
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

&mdash; William Shakespeare -- As You Like It<br/>
