> Here’s to the crazy ones.
> <br/>The misfits.
> <br/>The rebels.
> <br/>The troublemakers.
> <br/>The round pegs in the square holes.
> <br/>
> <br/>The ones who see things differently.
> <br/>They’re not fond of rules.
> <br/>And they have no respect for the status quo.
> <br/>You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
> <br/>
> <br/>About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.
> <br/>Because they change things.
> <br/>They invent.
> <br/>They imagine.
> <br/>They heal.
> <br/>They explore.
> <br/>They create.
> <br/>They inspire.
> <br/>They push the human race forward.
> <br/>Maybe they have to be crazy.
> <br/>
> <br/>How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
> <br/>
> <br/>We make tools for these kinds of people.
> <br/>
> <br/>While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
> <br/>Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
