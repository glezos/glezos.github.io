This weekend [@andy_lupo](http://twitter.com/andy_lupo) and me will head north to Thessaloniki to present at the FOSS-Communities Conference some of the kewl technologies we're using at [Indifex](http://www.indifex.com/). Andreas' talk is titled "Multi-GB databases with NoSQL" and mine "Extreme Web Programming".

Additionally, I was humbled to be invited from the local entrepreneur's club OpenCoffee to present at their [weekend event](http://opencoffee.gr/2010/04/15/oc-slk-xiv/). I'll talk about open-source business models and the lessons learned while building Indifex. The talk is titled "Transifex: Developing Open Source Software for fun and profit".

So looking forward to this trip. I hope the weather is nice on Friday evening!
