  There is nothing wrong with your television. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. 

  We are now controlling the transmission. We control the horizontal and the vertical. We can deluge you with a thousand channels or expand one single image to crystal clarity and beyond. We can shape your vision to anything our imagination can conceive. For the next hour we will control all that you see and hear.

  You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the deepest inner mind to the outer limits.
