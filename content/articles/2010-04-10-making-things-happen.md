LWN.net interviewed Leslie Hawthorn, the main person behind Google Summer of Code. I liked how a small team in a big company Google can feel like a startup sometimes.

> I think the most important lesson I learned was to just get out there and **make things happen**, no matter how many mistakes you'll make along the way and no matter how many pairs of eyes are watching you make those mistakes. When I started with the team, I had no FOSS experience whatsoever and was quite worried about doing the wrong thing, and very publicly no less. Over time, I realized the it was far better to make as much progress as possible and make the **inevitable course corrections** required rather than try to get everything right from the start.

> I've also learned that a small group of people who are dedicated to **making the world a better place** can be incredibly successful in doing just that. It may sound like a cliche, but I never imagined when I started working on Summer of Code that I would have the chance to help so many individuals and projects make things better.
