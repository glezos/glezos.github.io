&lt;p&gt;While I am not sure of many things, here are a few things I do believe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, the comments feature of my weblog is something that I find the most enjoyable and rewarding aspects of my site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I welcome thoughtful and respectful expressions of alternate points of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some topics that I am interested in that others seem to find as irresistable temptations to bash one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody has an inalienable right to place information on my website.  If you have something to say, I encourage you to get your own weblog.  Feel free to use trackback to draw attention to your comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the above, I would like to find a solution less drastic than disabling comments, blocking of ip address, or wholesale removal of comments. That being said, I do reserve the right to selectively employ one or more of the above in situations I feel warrant it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the best solution I have come up with is to mark up the portions I find objectionable with links to this page. No words are addded, deleted, or rearranged in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggestions are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="text"></category><category term="text"></category></entry><entry><title>xkcd and abstraction layers</title><link href="https://dimitris.glezos.com/weblog/2012/02/17/xkcd-and-abstraction-layers/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-02-17T08:25:09+00:00</published><updated>2012-02-17T08:25:09+00:00</updated><author><name>glezos-blog</name></author><id>tag:dimitris.glezos.com,2012-02-17:/weblog/2012/02/17/xkcd-and-abstraction-layers/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="None" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzj3bwum8y1qati3p.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was invited to write a column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Partners presents the voices of six young entrepreneurs who are rising above the status quo to take control of their professional careers, with all the difficulties this involves, and experience life from a different vantage point. And they offer insights into shifts—of beliefs, of values, of perspectives—that, at this time of upheaval and despair, will move Greece forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my take on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="innovation-solutions-and-effectiveness"&gt;Innovation, Solutions, and Effectiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an entrepreneur and a pattern recognition geek, I am very often tempted
to compare Greece’s challenges with those of a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups are businesses at their extremes. One day you’re the king of the
world at the top of the mountain, invincible against your competition. The
next day you’re in the valley, wondering how on earth you’ll survive the
imminent and inevitable end of your world. And while entrepreneurs often have
optimism engraved in their DNA to be able to survive (and thrive), a
startup’s roller-coaster life, and a negative ecosystem, can drain it out
from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m often asked what were the biggest challenges I faced in founding
Transifex. Expected answers, such as bureaucracy and taxation, are always
areas a country can improve on. But the biggest challenge for me was a
different one: To keep looking at things positively. To keep believing that
change is possible and you’re a part of it. If I had a magic wand, I’d switch
the negativity being pushed by the media before a good night’s sleep, or by
the grocery store owner before a good morning, with constructive criticism
with realistic propositions and a thumbs-up with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empowerment will prove to be an important element of Greece’s fight for
survival. From entrepreneurs to employees, from citizens to ministers and the
prime minister himself, everybody needs to feel empowered to fight for a
better tomorrow. Citizens need to feel empowered to be part of the change and
fight to bring new value the next day. This cultural change requires many
years to improve, but that’s no reason not to start working on it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece is challenged today to innovate itself out of its doom, whirlpool. In
any system which brought itself to such a bad state, innovation, or improving
its own parameters, is a necessary element for escape. And while lots of
people are busy with inventing solutions, some few are busy in innovating new
solutions, that is, ones which will be effective in improving the current
state in a significant way. These people are smarter than the ones which
brought the system to the current state. Let’s identify them, remove all
their obstacles and provide them with all the necessary tools to do great
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness is key. Both optimized systems, as well as ones which have been
broken for decades, which represents the case of Greece, require hard work to
fix. When resources such as budget and time are limited, being effective is
key for success. The right solutions should be brought to the table today and
ways to get them implemented soon should be found.&lt;/p&gt;

I found this excellent article from NY Times called "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/opinion/20friedman.html?_r=1"&gt;Can Greeks Become Germans?&lt;/a&gt;", which summarizes the problem in a very detailed way. I'll quote some large sections here, for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] Germany is the epitome of a country that made itself rich by making stuff.
Greece, alas, after it joined the European Union in 1981, actually became
just another Middle East petro-state — only instead of an oil well, it had
Brussels, which steadily pumped out subsidies, aid and euros with low
interest rates to Athens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural resources create corruption, as groups compete for who controls the
tap. That is exactly what happened in Greece when it got access to huge
Euro-loans and subsidies. &lt;strong&gt;The natural entrepreneurship of Greeks was
channeled in the wrong direction — in a competition for government funds and
contracts.&lt;/strong&gt; To be sure, it wasn’t all squandered. Greece had a real
modernization spurt in the 1990s. But after 2002, it put its feet up,
thinking it had arrived, and too much “Euro-oil” from the European Union went
back to financing a corrupt, patrimonial system whereby politicians dispensed
government jobs and projects to localities in return for votes. This
reinforced a huge welfare state, where young people dreamed of a cushy
government job and everyone from cabdrivers to truckers to pharmacists to
lawyers was allowed to erect barriers to entry that artificially inflated
prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union membership “was a big opportunity for development, and we
wasted it,” explained Dimitris Bourantas, a professor of management at Athens
University. “We also did not take advantage of the markets of the [formerly]
socialist countries around Greece. And we also did not take advantage of the
growth of the global economy. We lost them all because &lt;strong&gt;the political system
was focused on growing public administration — not on [fostering]
entrepreneurship, competition or industrial strategy or competitive
advantages&lt;/strong&gt;. We created a state with big inefficiencies, corruption and a very
large bureaucracy. We were the last Soviet country in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, he added, that &lt;strong&gt;Greeks, when they move to the U.S., “unleash
their skills and entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;” in ways that enable them to thrive in
commerce. But here in Greece, the system encourages just the opposite.
Investors here tell you that the red tape involved in starting a new business
is overwhelming. It’s crazy; Greece is the only country in the world where
Greeks don’t behave like Greeks. Their welfare state, financed by Euro-oil,
has bred it out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the decline of Beirut and Dubai, Athens should have become the service
center of the Eastern Mediterranean. Instead, Cyprus and Istanbul seized that
role. Greece must not waste this crisis. While it has instituted some reforms
in the last year, Prime Minister George Papandreou said to me, “&lt;strong&gt;What is most
frustrating is the resistance in the system. How do you produce a change in
culture?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take a cultural revolution. And that can happen only if Greece’s two
major parties come together, hold hands, and collectively force through a
radical change in the governing culture from the top down. Without that,
Greece will never be able to pay back its loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

development server, but instead do that from inside my tests. This way I will
work directly on my test database which runs with my test fixtures and when
I'm ready, I'll just write the necessary assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I talked about rendering the test client's &lt;a href="http://miniblog.glezos.com/post/3388080372/tests-browser"&gt;responses in the
browser&lt;/a&gt; to view the
results of your tests live, before choosing the correct assertions. This time
I'm wrapping the code in a while loop to iterate over my development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something different than test-driven development. This way you don't
run your tests for every development iteration, but rather you just "stuck"
your test case until you like what you see in your code. Here's an example
from a unit test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;transifex.txcommon.tests.utils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_in_browser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_homepage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;anonymous&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_in_browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;halt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Loop control:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raw_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Halted. [r]eload, drop to [s]hell or any other key to continue: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;IPython.Shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IPShellEmbed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IPShellEmbed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when I run the test, my browser opens up showing how my homepage looks
like. I start tweaking the template, hit &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; and view the page in the
browser again. When I'm satisfied with what I see, I copy-paste from the
browser some of the test I want to assert against and hit 's' to drop in a
shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write my assertions there, in-place, with the test data initialized and
ready to be asserted against. When I'm happy with those assertions, I just
copy-paste them in the test case and remove the while statement and loop control code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of testing &amp;amp; development works well for template testing. I'm not sure how this should be called. It's test-wrapped development or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that the following config variables will be needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TEMPLATE_DEBUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;CACHE_BACKEND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;dummy://&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

You can test any Python method, your models, your views and even your templates. In the latter case, you're actually testing the rendered response of a view with a specific context. Most of the times, this result is HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write my assertion, I often need to query for a particular string in the response's content. I end up &lt;a href="http://miniblog.glezos.com/post/401011795/django-ipython"&gt;opening ipython&lt;/a&gt;, print the result and try to find something in that mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This takes a lot of time, because the command-line window isn't the best HTML renderer in the world. Here's a simple method to take the response content and render it in a browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;response_in_browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;halt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Open a browser and render the response&amp;#39;s content.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;tempfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;webbrowser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tempfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NamedTemporaryFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flush&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;webbrowser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Give the browser a chance to open the file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just call it from inside any test of yours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;myUrlName&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;txcommon.tests.utils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_in_browser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;response_in_browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your browser will open for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="None" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgvubuaB0s1qati3p.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first issues you might face is seeing a style-less page. This
happens becuase the test server isn't really a web server, and you're probably
serving static files from something relative such as &lt;code&gt;'/site_media'&lt;/code&gt;. The
solution is simple: Run a separate Django server and tweak your
development-only static URL to something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATIC_URL = &amp;#39;http://localhost:8000/site_media/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will trick the temporary window to show the test's HTML with the static files served from the server. Voilà:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="None" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgvuc5Rq8Z1qati3p.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then use your browser's browser's super tools such as 'View Source' and 'Inspect Element'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strapatsada, or kagiana, is a simple dish for breakfast or dinner. Basically, it's a dish of scrambled eggs with added tomatoes and feta cheese. This way it becomes more like a 'dish' by itself -- the only thing that needs now is some bread, chapata etc. Its name comes from the italian word 'strapazzare' which means scramble, mistreat or chop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning. This is &lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=strapatsada"&gt;not a good-looking food&lt;/a&gt;. But its taste is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="ingredients"&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serves 3 people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;300g feta cheese, medium hardness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6-8 mid-sized tomatoes. Juices are needed in this dish, so ripe tomatoes are preferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tbsp tomato purée&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tsp Indian &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garam_masala"&gt;Garam Masala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 fresh chilies, very finely chopped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 tbsp milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, my variation is to use garam masala spice mixture for flavor, chilies for hotness and some milk for fluffiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="how"&gt;How?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peel tomatoes and grate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut feta cheese in square cubes (e.g. 1cm big)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sauté tomatoes and chillies in olive oil. Add respective salt and pepper. Cook for a couple of minutes, until almost all the juices evaporate and you have a nice sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In parallel, beat eggs until a solid mixture and before they start to produce any foam. Stir in milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put eggs in pan. Stir like common scrambled eggs: Use a flat spatula to constantly push mixture towards the center of the pan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the mixture &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; loosing its liquids, add feta cheese.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the mixture looses all its liquids remove from fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve immediately. Goes well with some crispy bread, like grilled thin pita bread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldqsmzRFLP1qati3p.jpg" alt="kagianas" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="tips"&gt;Tips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the simplicity and little cooking time of this food, your core ingredients (eggs, feta cheese) should be of good quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tomatoes can be easily peeled when put into hot water for 1 minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use food processor/multi for grating tomatoes. It breaks the seeds and adds bitterness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tomato purée adds 'depth' to the color (orange-red instead of light-organge) and flavor of tomatoes, and thickens the sauce. Its a must-add IMHO, otherwise your dish might end up having some liquids in the plate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like good scrambled eggs, your strapatsada should be fluffy. You want to get a solid mixture but which the egg has not completely lost all its liquids, otherwise the dish will be somewhat 'dry'. Milk or creme helps here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that after removing from the heat, the food continues to cook slightly for the next 30 seconds due to resident heat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't use oregano because it adds small dry pieces in the bite. Like good scrambled eggs, the greatness of this dish is its simplicity, and for this reason I'd avoid the temptation to add any omelette ingredient like ball peppers, onions, sausages etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh chillies add freshness to the dish and a slight "unbalance" in chewing (some bites are a bit more spicy). This is nice due to the simplicity of the dish. Alternatively, one can use chili powder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garam_masala"&gt;Garam masala&lt;/a&gt; spice blend can be replaced with a good mix of similar spices. Refer to the wikipedia page for more info.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister was giving a talk at the biggest exhibition/fair in Greece (and probably the Balkans) which was broadcasted live by TV media and was being watched by a few million people (wow). In his talk about development and innovation, he mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us, sustainability means investing in people, knowledge
acquisition, technology assimilation, investing in our own products,
knowledge, history, skills, and aesthetic quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we can do it, yes, it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People around us prove it every day. They are the revolution of the evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People like Dimitris Glezos, based in Patras, who started Indifex and created an on-line platform used by thousands of translators from around the world to translate computer programs in multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This totally caught me by surprise, and it's still kind of hard to believe. It's such an honor and a proof that we should be bold and take the step, dare to try new things and insist in pursuing our dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I feel more motivated and psyched than ever. But most importantly, I feel grateful for everyone who is following our progress and respects our work. Your support means so much, and it's translated to our work as pure motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 9. It was a hot summer day in Cyprus at my grandmother's back yard. My bicycle hit top speed, but chose a rather unfortunate and irreparable route towards the hen-house, resulting to my landing on a pile of mud and chicken poop. I sat down and watched the chicken stare at me, probably thinking something along the lines of "What a wacko."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run to the house to brag about the mess I did with a huge smile on my face, only to find 15 relatives of mine --grandparents, aunts, cousins, in a my-big-fat-greek-wedding style-- preparing the birthday cake. We couldn't stop laughing with the smell and the picture of my clothes and face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later I blew the candles. My wish was to remember this very happy moment ten years later and continue getting myself into similarly hilarious places and situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day I was turning 19 was a hot summer day, albeit without my face covered in poop. Instead, I found myself in the shower with a whole bunch of finely-chopped green parsley all over me. A buddy of mine finally managed to get back at me for a similarly crazy prank I did to him. We laughed 'till tears came out. At that point I remembered the hen-house incident, along with the promise I made to myself back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade later, these incidents are still coming back to me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past years were a blessing to me. I feel so fortunate for everything that has happened to me, and I feel grateful to all my friends, my family and the people I worked with. Thank you all for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday wacko. Here's to another 10 years full of joy and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to all the crazy people out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our &lt;a href="http://www.indifex.com/"&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; is scattered across the planet, we're having regular VoIP/Skype calls, so we bought a couple of good headsets to use. We're trying out &lt;a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/webcam-communications/internet-headsets-phones/devices/3622"&gt;Logitech Headset Clearchat Pro Usb&lt;/a&gt; which has a 2-year guarantee &lt;a href="http://www.plaisio.gr/Peripherals/PC-Peripherals/Speakers-Headsets-Microphones/Headsets/Logitech-Headset-Clearchat-Pro-Usb-981-000011.htm"&gt;from the local computer store PLAISIO&lt;/a&gt; (this shop has the best support ever).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once connected to Fedora 13 on the USB port, the headset was detected automatically by Pulseaudio. The name matched, the microphone worked, and the digital volume control buttons on the headphones worked perfectly with Pulseaudio. Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that no sound came out of the speakers. Since the microphone worked, I imagined it was a problem in the Output channel somehow. Based on &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/566449"&gt;this bug report&lt;/a&gt; I fired &lt;code&gt;alsamixer&lt;/code&gt;, selected the USB Headset device, and found the volume level to be 0. Once the volume there was increased, oh bliss, sound came out of the headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this took 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what I remember needing to do to get scanning work on this networked all-in-one machine setup to scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup necessary packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;xsane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;frontends&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Actual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;drivers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;libsane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hpaio&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Front&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hplip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gui&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;simple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;xsane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gimp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup machine to have a static IP for future easy reference (192.168.1.50 in my case). This can be done using the machine menus. Once you know this IP, you can play around with the settings from your computer by pointing your browser to that IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, theoretically one can fire up &lt;code&gt;hp-toolbox&lt;/code&gt; and add the printer &amp;amp; scanner from there, by adding a network printer and filling in the IP. But this tool died on me with a message "Restart CUPS". So, here's the workaround I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Create HP URIs:
hp-makeuri -g 192.168.1.50

&lt;span class="gh"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Test temporarily:
xsane hpaio:/net/Officejet_6500_E709a?ip=192.168.1.50
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup the device permanently and the SANE backend to always discover it, the following did the trick (notice the prefix &lt;code&gt;hp:/&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo vi /etc/cups/printers.conf
[Change DeviceURI to &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`hp:/net/Officejet_6500_E709a?ip=192.168.1.50`&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To scan, fire up &lt;code&gt;simple-scan&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;xsane&lt;/code&gt;, or from GIMP, choose File→Create→XSane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's worth noting that flegita, the GNOME scanning tool, simply crashes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="text"></category><category term="text"></category></entry><entry><title>Creepy introduction #2</title><link href="https://dimitris.glezos.com/weblog/2010/06/06/fuel-cells/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-06T10:55:54+00:00</published><updated>2010-06-06T10:55:54+00:00</updated><author><name>glezos-blog</name></author><id>tag:dimitris.glezos.com,2010-06-06:/weblog/2010/06/06/fuel-cells/</id><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some searching around, I figured out I need to install &lt;code&gt;polkit-gnome&lt;/code&gt;. We now have a special group called 'desktop_admin_r', and polkit is already setup to read from that group the desktop admins. So the new way to make GNOME ask your password instead of the root one, the following commands should just work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo yum install polkit-gnome
usermod -a -G desktop_admin_r mits
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, gksudo is something completely different. And more evil. =/&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="text"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="tech/web"></category><category term="foss"></category></entry><entry><title>Geek by nature, Linux by choice</title><link href="https://dimitris.glezos.com/weblog/2010/04/21/geek-by-nature-linux-by-choice/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-21T00:12:39+00:00</published><updated>2010-04-21T00:12:39+00:00</updated><author><name>glezos-blog</name></author><id>tag:dimitris.glezos.com,2010-04-21:/weblog/2010/04/21/geek-by-nature-linux-by-choice/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/andy_lupo"&gt;@andy_lupo&lt;/a&gt; and me will head north to Thessaloniki to present at the FOSS-Communities Conference some of the kewl technologies we're using at &lt;a href="http://www.indifex.com/"&gt;Indifex&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the most important lesson I learned was to just get out there and &lt;strong&gt;make things happen&lt;/strong&gt;, no matter how many mistakes you'll make along the way and no matter how many pairs of eyes are watching you make those mistakes. When I started with the team, I had no FOSS experience whatsoever and was quite worried about doing the wrong thing, and very publicly no less. Over time, I realized the it was far better to make as much progress as possible and make the &lt;strong&gt;inevitable course corrections&lt;/strong&gt; required rather than try to get everything right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also learned that a small group of people who are dedicated to &lt;strong&gt;making the world a better place&lt;/strong&gt; can be incredibly successful in doing just that. It may sound like a cliche, but I never imagined when I started working on Summer of Code that I would have the chance to help so many individuals and projects make things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fred Wilson (avc.com) has written an insightful blog post titled "&lt;a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/03/does-rest-of-world-matter-more-than-the-us.html"&gt;Does Rest Of World Matter More Than The US?&lt;/a&gt;". Fred believes that localization is key to monetize outside of the US:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web sector needs to &lt;strong&gt;start working harder on international monetization&lt;/strong&gt;. [...]
Web services that are highly international today should invest in fully localizing their user experience and then start thinking about monetizing outside of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;reason d'etre&lt;/em&gt; of web services like &lt;a href="http://www.transifex.net/"&gt;Transifex&lt;/a&gt;: the vast majority of international speakers, who can stay on your website twice as much and have 4x more chances of buying something, if your website speaks their native language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the US traffic can achieve (much) higher monetization than other countries in most industries, but the monetization does follow the high numbers of international visitors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if international traffic could only be monetized 25% as well as US traffic, when your international traffic is 80% of your total traffic, you would make &lt;strong&gt;as much money internationally as domestically&lt;/strong&gt;. So that's a lot of potential out there to be tapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting comment was made by daveclark, mentioning that the cost of winning a local market shouldn't be underestimated. Businesses which 'inherently scale friction-free across markets' should 'game on', while others might need much more work than just localizing the user interface (think, for example, selling shoes or books). Lots of good comments on the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past days I learned great things today about Mercurial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out Joel Spolsky's &lt;a href="hginit.com"&gt;hginit.com&lt;/a&gt;. It teaches you the key concepts behind hg in a way which doesn't mess with complex internals, but focuses on what's important: the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out that the latest version of the hgtk history window supports running an 'Outgoing' command, which directly marks the nodes which will be pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that sometimes when I rebase, I get a merged head node instead of a linear history. That is, the rebase doesn't work 100%. Not sure why this was happening, but I found a few hackish workarounds. The funny thing is that I also found a solution: I then rebased the branche's root node on top of the merged node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now understand that the problem was much simpler: I just run accidentally hg rebase with &lt;code&gt;--source&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;--branch&lt;/code&gt;. The first flag rebases a single node and the latter a whole branch. So, obviously, only the last node was "rebased" to look on top of tip. Instead, when you rebase with &lt;code&gt;--branch&lt;/code&gt;, the branche's base node is rebased, and the history is, of course, linearized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success.&lt;/p&gt;

The first two lines go somewhere in your module and the latter wherever you want to hook up with the shell (tests, models, views). This can serve as a more rich alternative to `ipdb.set_trace()`.
