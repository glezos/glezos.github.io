&lt;p&gt;The reason you have arived here is probably due to the fact that the owner of this web site has deemed some portion of a comment as flamebait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am not sure of many things, here are a few things I do believe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, the comments feature of my weblog is something that I find the most enjoyable and rewarding aspects of my site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I welcome thoughtful and respectful expressions of alternate points of view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some topics that I am interested in that others seem to find as irresistable temptations to bash one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody has an inalienable right to place information on my website.  If you have something to say, I encourage you to get your own weblog.  Feel free to use trackback to draw attention to your comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the above, I would like to find a solution less drastic than disabling comments, blocking of ip address, or wholesale removal of comments. That being said, I do reserve the right to selectively employ one or more of the above in situations I feel warrant it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the best solution I have come up with is to mark up the portions I find objectionable with links to this page. No words are addded, deleted, or rearranged in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggestions are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="text"></category><category term="text"></category></entry><entry><title>xkcd and abstraction layers</title><link href="https://dimitris.glezos.com/weblog/2012/02/17/xkcd-and-abstraction-layers/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-02-17T08:25:09+00:00</published><updated>2012-02-17T08:25:09+00:00</updated><author><name>glezos-blog</name></author><id>tag:dimitris.glezos.com,2012-02-17:/weblog/2012/02/17/xkcd-and-abstraction-layers/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="None" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzj3bwum8y1qati3p.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was invited to write a column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Partners presents the voices of six young entrepreneurs who are rising above the status quo to take control of their professional careers, with all the difficulties this involves, and experience life from a different vantage point. And they offer insights into shifts—of beliefs, of values, of perspectives—that, at this time of upheaval and despair, will move Greece forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my take on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="innovation-solutions-and-effectiveness"&gt;Innovation, Solutions, and Effectiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an entrepreneur and a pattern recognition geek, I am very often tempted
to compare Greece’s challenges with those of a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups are businesses at their extremes. One day you’re the king of the
world at the top of the mountain, invincible against your competition. The
next day you’re in the valley, wondering how on earth you’ll survive the
imminent and inevitable end of your world. And while entrepreneurs often have
optimism engraved in their DNA to be able to survive (and thrive), a
startup’s roller-coaster life, and a negative ecosystem, can drain it out
from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m often asked what were the biggest challenges I faced in founding
Transifex. Expected answers, such as bureaucracy and taxation, are always
areas a country can improve on. But the biggest challenge for me was a
different one: To keep looking at things positively. To keep believing that
change is possible and you’re a part of it. If I had a magic wand, I’d switch
the negativity being pushed by the media before a good night’s sleep, or by
the grocery store owner before a good morning, with constructive criticism
with realistic propositions and a thumbs-up with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empowerment will prove to be an important element of Greece’s fight for
survival. From entrepreneurs to employees, from citizens to ministers and the
prime minister himself, everybody needs to feel empowered to fight for a
better tomorrow. Citizens need to feel empowered to be part of the change and
fight to bring new value the next day. This cultural change requires many
years to improve, but that’s no reason not to start working on it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece is challenged today to innovate itself out of its doom, whirlpool. In
any system which brought itself to such a bad state, innovation, or improving
its own parameters, is a necessary element for escape. And while lots of
people are busy with inventing solutions, some few are busy in innovating new
solutions, that is, ones which will be effective in improving the current
state in a significant way. These people are smarter than the ones which
brought the system to the current state. Let’s identify them, remove all
their obstacles and provide them with all the necessary tools to do great
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness is key. Both optimized systems, as well as ones which have been
broken for decades, which represents the case of Greece, require hard work to
fix. When resources such as budget and time are limited, being effective is
key for success. The right solutions should be brought to the table today and
ways to get them implemented soon should be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;The ones who see things differently.

&lt;br/&gt;About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.
&lt;br/&gt;Because they change things.
&lt;br/&gt;They invent.
&lt;br/&gt;They imagine.
&lt;br/&gt;They heal.
&lt;br/&gt;They explore.
&lt;br/&gt;They create.
&lt;br/&gt;They inspire.
&lt;br/&gt;They push the human race forward.
&lt;br/&gt;Maybe they have to be crazy.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We make tools for these kinds of people.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
&lt;br/&gt;Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.&lt;/p&gt;
