		<li class="entry"><p>Upon returning from <a href="/weblog/2008/09/06/fudcon-brno-on-its-way/">FUDCon</a>, I had a lot of things needing attention, so here’s a wrap-up post on this uber-cool conference.</p>
<p><img alt="fudcon" src="/photos/6459-2/dsc_6503.jpg"></p>
<p>First of all, I think I’ll agree with Max that this was probably our best FUDCon so far. Not wanting to decrease the importance of other FUDCons, the fact that the folks at Brno put up their best to have every little detail covered was pretty much obvious to the participants. Content, venue, wireless, food, hotel — everything was good. Thumbs-up to everyone who put a helping hand!</p>
<p><img alt="Nicu" src="/photos/6551-2/dsc_6642.jpg"><br>
Nicu</p>
<p>As usual, I took the chance of the conference to invade people’s comfort zones by taking portrait photos of them. I <a href="/photos/events/">like doing so</a> in events, since I think it’s a good way one can describe the atmosphere of an event. I’ve just uploaded a bunch of pictures taken from my camera (either by me, <a href="http://cmpahar.wordpress.com/">cmpahar</a> or anyone who got a hold of it):</p>
<p><a href="/photos/events/fudcon-brno-08/">/photos/events/fudcon-brno-08/</a></p>
<h3 id="barcamp">Barcamp</h3>
<p>The second day was the Barcamp. I attended a few quite interesting presentations. Jeroen held a <strong>Custom Spins</strong> one and answered a few technical questions of mine. Max dealt with some Fedora-related questions I also had, like what different levels of ‘officiality’ spins there are (3rd party, approved, and releng-supported ones). The idea of having a framework in place for localized spins got into my mind once again — would be great if we either torrent-shipped language-specific and/or location-specific spins. For example, I learned from Diego that the word ‘OpenOffice’ is trademarked in Brazil and they have to replace the package with <a href="http://www.broffice.org/">BrOffice</a>. Having an framework that allows local communities build, host, and support more or less these spins would be a pretty good thing IMO. Now, if only I could make days longer. :-)</p>
<p><img alt="JonRob" src="/photos/6399-2/dsc_6426.jpg"><br>

<p>The OLPC folks discussed a feature they’re working on which personally I’m looking forward to it in great anticipation: <strong>Sugar on Fedora</strong>. The package is already there, but those hackers are working with Greg to make it seamlessly available as a normal Desktop, available through GDM and stuff. Amazing. This could turn normal PCs in schools into OLPC-like ecosystems, lowering the barrier of a school (and country) to experiment and use these modern educational tools. They’re also working in getting the spin they’re using as close to Fedora as possible — working with <strong>upstream</strong> more, and of course, as a benefit, reduce their maintenance costs. Looking forward to both features.</p>
<p><img alt="In need of sleep" src="/photos/6487-2/dsc_6544.jpg"></p>
<p>My talk was right after lunch. I wrote a few things in the previous post, not much more to say about it. I’ll try to transcribe it in this week, however I’m not good at predicting these kind of stuff. Let’s just hope I’ll be able to grab a couple of hours from an evening or night of mine and get this done, as a couple of people has requested it. Will try, as I think I still haven’t got a proper rest from the event.</p>
<p>A little later <a href="/photos/events/fudcon-brno-08/dsc_6430.jpg.html">Francesco Ugolini</a> described a few idea he has on the <strong>Ambassadors project</strong>. Listening to them made me very happy, as I realized that some discussions we had with him and other folks in the project are gradually becoming a reality. The Ambassadors project is all about having a global effort for spreading the word on Fedora — it has a budget, a very active central committee, and is extremely good in organizing these stuff. The Localization Project, on the other hand, is very good in forming local teams working on Fedora; both on technical stuff (translations) as well as on local LUG presentations, meetings, release parties. So it makes <em>total</em> sense to help both projects get more by working together. For example, a bunch of Fedora folks in Italy want to spend a weekend fixing bugs or having a translation marathon? The Ambassadors project (with the Community Architecture team) can help them get there, maybe by buying them the pizza and drinks. So, I really think we’ve got a good ecosystem in both projects that serves different purposes, and using them together can help us achieve more. :-)</p>
<p><img alt="FUDPub" src="/photos/6451-2/dsc_6498.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>FUDPub</strong> included, as usual, good food and loads of beer. Some Fedorans were singing with guitars, while the rest of us chatting and taking lots of photos (some well-lit, some not).</p>
<h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3>
<p>Next day it was hacking day again. Transifex packaging, work on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicubunu/2835751940/">adding translation statistics support</a>, and talking with people. Later on we went to the Brno city center for sightseeing. Yet another pub in the evening, making a 5 out of 5 evenings with beer in Brno.</p>
<p>Other notable FUDCon happenings:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/photos/events/fudcon-brno-08/dsc_6642.jpg.html">Nicu</a>‘s FUDCon web comic “Size matters” was fantastic. <a href="http://nicubunu.blogspot.com/2008/09/fedora-weekly-webcomic-fudcon-special.html">Everyone in the amphitheater</a> burst into laughs when they read it.</li>
<li>The event’s T-shirt is fantastic. Judging by his smile, I think Max enjoyed giving them out as much as we enjoyed receiving them.</li>
<li><a href="/photos/events/fudcon-brno-08/dsc_6474.jpg.html">Chris Bacharakis</a> once again gave us some good laughs. Returning to Patras a few people were actually asking “tell us a funny story that happened with Chris”. And of course there are many, including the one where Chris tried to ask the tram to stop at the tram stop by pressing the red button on top of the door. The tram of course stopped. Immediately. A guy in the 70s was ejected on the front glass, an old lady almost took off, and we were trying to realize what just happened.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="FUDPub" src="/photos/6539-2/dsc_6627.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>Had a good laugh at the pub on the last day, where me, as a guy that avoids meat as much as possible, <em>had</em> to order something from the steakhouse’s menu (haven’t eaten all day). I ordered what seemed the most innocent choice on the menu… which ended up being the <a href="/photos/events/fudcon-brno-08/dsc_6665.jpg.html">biggest dish</a> of the 15-something others on the table. It was a leg knuckle, apparently, which was bigger than my plate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next day I took the train for Vienna, and then the plane to Athens, wondering when and where the next European FUDCon will take place, and what I’ll present there.</p>
<p>Until next time then!</p>

		<li class="entry"><p>Yes! A small window of time to blog about what’s up in Brno!</p>
<h3 id="t-1-fudcon">T-1 FUDCon</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vienna</strong>. Delicious food, museums. Tourist guides neglect to mention that apparently Vienna causes burned-out feet. And a good-night’s sleep didn’t seem to help.</li>
<li><strong>Travel to Brno</strong> by train was pretty cool. Diego found it a bit strange that taking a 1.5-hour train from Vienna can buy beer 700% cheaper. And mind you, some beers in Brno are <a href="http://www.bernard.cz/sub_page.php?page=143&amp;parent=0">darn good</a>.</li>
<li>Next day we’re <strong>at the Brno Red Hat</strong> office with <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DavidCantrell">David</a>. More or less hacked all day long, among discussions with office-locals Marek, Josef and Radek. Some major things accomplished were a good discussion with Diego and Christos from Greece on plans for reusable data validations in Tx and API completion along with the CLI. I went into deep meditation for a few minutes drawing on the blackboard deciding how to handle the merging of all the branches we have around (7 of them?).</li>
<li>Mexican lunch brought a discussion with the <strong>Anaconda</strong> team on their localization challenges, and tips on how to debug similar issues. Glad to <em>meet in person</em> a few developers like Nils Philippsen, Lubomir Kundrak who are using Transifex to localize their apps and with whom we had a few good online discussions.</li>
<li>End of day0, had an <strong>International dinner</strong> which proved <a href="http://gregdek.livejournal.com/34452.html">not international</a> <a href="http://spevack.livejournal.com/64250.html">enough</a> — no Czech person to help us communicate with the waitresses! Next time I’ll try to be careful for both what I’m saying in CZ and the way I’m waving my hands, as I managed to order a 3-person Greek salad for each person on the table. Oops.</li>
<li>Learned a lot while walking to the venue of day one about the <strong>challenges inherit in the OLPC</strong> efforts. Change is difficult, and it’s even a bigger challenge</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hackfest">Hackfest</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ah, the hackfest. Rough day for me — was on the mobile phone for most of the day with European Parliament members for some urgent issues. Had the chance to work on a few issues on our Damned Lies (@$#) instance, but not much time (and energy) left to do something more important. Looking forward for tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jumping a day later: Tx presentation went pretty well. We were around 20 people from various groups: Developers, translators, project managers. Got some good questions and more energy to get a common instance up and going soon.</p>
<p>Off for the social event now. More updates tomorrow.</p></li>

		<li class="entry"><p>Here we are, at FUDCon Brno! A big thanks to the folks at the RH Brno office for taking care of everything we might need so far. Hotel, breakfast, venue, network — all is good, so off for a full day of hacking.</p>
<p>Transifex is one of the 6 hacking sessions today. I’m sitting with Diego and a few other hackers, and we’ve put up for consideration a few goals for the weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Package Transifex (both server and client) in Fedora (<code>yum install</code> rocks)</li>
<li>Add support for <a href="http://transifex.org/wiki/Development/Statistics">translation statistics</a> in Transifex</li>
<li>Complete the API and add respective features in the CLI</li>
</ul>
<p>The task for today is statistics support. The plan is laid out on the wiki page, and we’ll probably hack our way through: work will be split in file operations (find the translation files in the code, prepopulate the DB table with them), stats calculation (get a file, calculate stiff) and presentation (UI, templates etc).</p></li>
