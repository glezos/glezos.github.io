		<li class="entry"><p>Either due to ignorance or simply blunt encouragement for my evil plans for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BRXmgcBHBM">World Domination</a> ™ (wicked music played in the background), I was appointed by Red Hat to take <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2009-January/msg00007.html">a seat on the Fedora Board</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll start off by saying a big ‘Thank you’ to all who supported my candidacy and this decision. Fedora has evolved into one of the most influential and vibrant Linux distributions today and it’s a great honour to serve on its <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Board">Board</a> and represent the community on the issues the Board is accountable for.</p>
<p>I joined Fedora as a contributor much later than a lot of other folks. I still remember the enthusiasm when my Fedora account was approved. Since then I got a lot of similar enthusiasms: first patch accepted, first influencial changeset accepted, email from the Leader, first conference… they’re so many. Now I’m yet again thrilled for having an opportunity to experience new things and serve the community in a different way.</p>
<p>The first thing on my agenda is take some time and grasp the new responsibilities and the areas I’d like to be accountable for. I’ve written quite a few big goals on <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Board/Elections/Nominations#Dimitris_Glezos_.28glezos.29">my mission statement</a> and I’d like to start talking with people right away about them.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I just booked myself a ticket to <a href="http://fosdem.org/2009/">FOSDEM</a>. I’ll mostly hang around the Fedora booth and the Python devroom, in case you’d like to find me and have some more TODOs added on my agenda. Or just fire up your email client and get in contact with any issues you’d like to discuss as part of my new role.</p>
<p>Off for some satanic thoughts now with my hot chocolate before going to bed.</p></li>

			</h2>
		</li>
		<li class="entry"><p>I was always enthusiastic about starting new projects, but it was only in the past couple of years that I got psyched to start <a href="http://www.indifex.com/">my own company</a>.</p>
<p>Projects like <a href="http://transifex.org/">software</a>, <a href="http://fedoraproject.gr/">communities</a>, even <a href="http://epatents.hellug.gr/">politics</a> sounded fun. While I had the entrepreneur bug for non-profit stuff, it was hidden for business. I’ve been fortunate to have really good jobs involving interesting projects and some fine hackers and managers around me. When I was in need for a change, I’d happily freelance or take some time off enjoying building stuff in my house, painting or maybe rock climbing for a while.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug">The bug</h3>
<p>For the past months I’ve been spending quite some time on <a href="http://transifex.org/">Transifex</a>. It started as a hack to integrate Fedora’s versioning systems, then we turned it into a translation submission web service, and translators started using it as a compliment to their workflow. You know you’re doing something useful when smart guys like Mozilla’s <a href="http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=298">Chris Blizzard</a> and rock-star software projects like the <a href="http://www.packagekit.org/">default packaging frontend</a> and <a href="http://pulseaudio.org/">sound server</a> for Linux distros find it ultra-useful.</p>
<p>You don’t often get the chance to change a <em>core bit</em> in an established technology like open source software localization. But when you actually do get the chance, it’s amazing how many paths open up. Hackers from GNOME and Debian and OLPC and Maemo and Wikipedia did not only like the idea behind upstream-friendly translation submissions, but they started thinking how it could fit into their infrastructure and workflow and how to extend it with new functionality. Folks around the world generously invited us to conferences to talk about our technology and plans, and guys from open source media like the popular LWN published <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/256144/">interviews</a> with us. Discussions with friends of the entrepreneur breed often went “wow” with the potential of the technology and were impressed that Tx was past the prototype stage and already into production.</p>
<h3 id="the-turning-point">The turning point</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a win-win situation. I’ve been very impressed with Transifex so far, it makes translations pretty trivial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Hughes, PackageKit maintainer</p>
<p>At some point, it became clear that we had the chance to make a big difference to a lot of people with Transifex. Translations are hard, and I’d bet anything that we can make them easier. Or, for a more modest approach, “make them suck less”.</p>
<p>For a long time the following question was spinning in my mind: “How can we build an <strong>open translation platform</strong> for software?” Starting from the assumption that translators are not tied into a specific project but are shared across them, how would the ultimate translation platform look like? I’d discuss it with people in conferences and startup meetings, drawing endless sketches of the architecture. We’d even talk it over in interviews with Google and Red Hat.</p>
<p>The goal is to build an efficient platform where producers of software, documents or web services can reach out to established localization communities to receive high-quality translations, which are then stored directly on the source repository of the product.</p>
<p>By far the best way to know if your idea is going to work is to try it out and see. Get a group of code hackers together and give it a try. And what better way to experiment this than <em>creating a startup</em> and hack your way through the challenges?</p>
<h3 id="the-project-and-the-startup">The project and the startup</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://transifex.net/">Transifex.net</a></strong> is the materialization of our vision. We’re developing a hosted version of Transifex, a common place where content providers can get their resources localized and translators can get together and find the tools they need to receive and submit back translatable content. To get there, we’ve re-written Transifex <em>from scratch</em> in the past months. We’ve re-engineering most of the concepts in it with one goal: create a solid base to accommodate the needs of most software projects.</p>
<p>Transifex will remain open source and continue being openly developed by our community at <a href="http://transifex.org/">transifex.org</a>. If you’re in doubt about the open source development model, take a look at <a href="http://ma.tt/2008/01/act-two/">how great WordPress is doing</a>.</p>
<p>Transifex.net is what WordPress.com is for WordPress. It’s a hosted version providing a hassle-free, social-enabled, batteries-included service. The open source version is still available for anyone wanting to host his own instance and we’re here to help him support it if needed.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.indifex.com/">Indifex</a></strong> is the company we founded to make this vision a reality. Indifex’s name, like Transifex, origins from latin and refers to something like <em>‘information craftsmen’</em> — it’s catchy and we dig it. And besides, we had to give it a name. =)</p>
<p>We’re a handful of passionate coders and open source geeks. We get high by fixing stuff and our office is lit up by technology flamewars almost every day. If you’re into these kind of kinky stuff too (modern web app frameworks, versioning systems, extreme programming, fast-paced work, pizza-only diet), take a look at the <a href="http://www.indifex.com/jobs/">job openings</a> we’ve got.</p>
<p>Indifex has received a fair amount of seed money to get us up and going for a while. If you’re into early-stage investments and would like to help us change the world, drop me an email at <em>glezos@indifex.com</em>.</p>
<h3 id="our-roadmap">Our roadmap</h3>
<p>So what are we planning for the next months?</p>
<p>We’re currently focusing on Transifex’s features which are most useful for translators. Soon we’ll roll out transifex.net in private beta to a few folks, in order to receive valuable feedback from the people who will likely make an extensive use of the service. At this time we’ll focus on bug squashing and product stabilization.</p>
<p>We’ll then gradually give out more invitations, re-iterating the process until we have something ready for public availability. Following the “release early, release often”, we hope to get there sooner than later.</p>
<p>That’s it from me. Now you can go and <a href="http://transifex.net/">subscribe to our beta program</a>, follow us on our <a href="http://blog.transifex.net/">blog</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/transifex">Twitter</a>, or take a look at the <a href="http://www.indifex.com/jobs/">job openings</a> we have.</p>
<p>Wrapping up with a quote from one of the first folks who believed in the dream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of how well Transifex is integrated as a technical and social solution, it has the chance to start a mini revolution in translation of libre/free and open source software.</p>
</blockquote>

		<li class="entry"><p>Ο φίλος μου <a href="http://begemott.deviantart.com/">Αλέξανδρος</a> μου ζήτησε μερικές συμβουλές σχετικά με το “άνοιγμα” μιας εφαρμογής σε ελεύθερο λογισμικό. Ξέθαψα το παρακάτω κείμενο με μερικές σκέψεις επ’ αυτού του θέματος.</p>
<hr>
<p>Είναι γεγονός ότι δεν είναι απλή υπόθεση να χτίσει κανείς ένα επιτυχημένο έργο ελεύθερου λογισμικού. Οι προκλήσεις που αντιμετωπίζει σαν maintainer είναι πολλών μορφών και εμφανίζονται σε διαφορετικές στιγμές, ενώ αρκετές από αυτές σε εκπλήσσουν. Δεν είναι τυχαίο λοιπόν που ίσως 9 στα 10 έργα ελεύθερου λογισμικού αποτυγχάνουν — είτε αυτό είναι από εγκατάλειψη των developers, αδιαφορία από τους χρήστες, έλευση ενός καλύτερου ανταγωνιστή, ή κάτι άλλο. Το ερώτημα είναι, φυσικά, δεδομένων αυτών, ποια είναι τα σημαντικότερα βήματα που πρέπει να ακολουθήσει ένας developer για να κάνει το έργο του να πετύχει;</p>
<p>Μια βασική αρχή που πρέπει να ακολουθεί ένας open source maintainer σε όλη τη διάρκεια του έργου του, και ειδικά στα πρώτα βήματα, είναι το KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. Με προεκτάσεις μέχρι τη φιλοσοφική αρχής του “Ξυραφιού του Όκαμ”, η κλασική αυτή σχεδιαστική αρχή του UNIX είναι βέβαιο ότι θα βοηθήσει ένα έργο να αναπτυχθεί σταθερά. Αν υπάρχει κάποιο υπάρχον έργο που μπορεί να βελτιωθεί με νέα χαρακτηριστικά, πιθανώς να αξίζει περισσότερο μια τέτοια προσέγγιση παρά μια επανεφεύρεση του τροχού.</p>
<p>Ίσως το καλύτερο σημείο να ξεκινήσει κανείς είναι να καταλάβει τη φύση της ανάπτυξης κώδικα ελεύθερου λογισμικού. Η πεμπτουσία του συστήματος αυτού είναι να αρέσει σε άλλους developers να συχνάζουν στο έργο. Ίσως το σημαντικότερο έργο που έχει να κάνει ο maintainer είναι να καταλαβαίνει τα κίνητρα τους, τι τους παρακινεί και γιατί βρίσκουν το δικό του έργο σούπερ. Να φροντίζει να συνεχίσουν να υπάρχουν ενδιαφέροντα προβλήματα να λυθούν, ή a la Eric Raymond, να υπάρχουν πάντα “itches to be scratched”. Όπως μου είχε πει μια φορά ο Max Spevack, πρώην Fedora Project Leader, όταν τον ρώτησα ποιος νιώθει ότι είναι ο στόχος της δουλειάς του, “ο ρόλος του leader είναι να μετακινεί εμπόδια ούτως ώστε εσύ, ο developer, να μπορείς να δημιουργείς ελεύθερα”.</p>
<p>Ένα σημαντικό πρώτο βήμα είναι το αρχείο README. Ένα καλό τέτοιο αρχείο δηλώνει τον σκοπό του έργου (mission statement), τους στόχους και τα use cases. Αρκετές φορές καλό είναι να αναφέρεται και το τι δεν είναι το έργο (ξανά το KISS). Δεδομένου του ότι ίσως η μεγαλύτερη πρόκληση του έργου είναι αυξήσει τον αριθμό των developers, η σημασία του αρχείου αυτού είναι μάλλον μεγάλη. Σε έναν ιδανικό κόσμο θα υπάρχουν σχέδια υλοποίησης και roadmap, αλλά η αλήθεια να λέγεται, το αρχείο δε χρειάζεται να είναι απόλυτα πλήρες από την αρχή.</p>
<p>Η επιλογή άδειας χρήσης (αρχείο LICENCE ή COPYING) είναι επίσης κάτι σημαντικό, αφού μπορεί να επηρεάσει τη συνδεσιμότητα του έργου με άλλα έργα και βιβλιοθήκες, ενώ δεν είναι εύκολο να αλλάξει στην πορεία. Ευτυχώς έχουμε στη διάθεση μας τις 5-6 σημαντικότερες άδειες που λογικά καλύπτουν το 99% των νέων έργων.</p>
<p>Με αυτά τα δύο — και προαιρετικά ίσως κάποιο βασικό, μίνιμαλ κώδικα — το freshmeat ή το sourceforge είναι ό,τι καλύτερο για ένα πρώτο “σπίτι” για το έργο και τις λύσεις που προτείνει. Μια mailing list (παρέχεται είτε από το sf, είτε πάμε σε Google groups, κλπ) και ένα URL για περισσότερες πληροφορίες, είναι ό,τι χρειαζόμαστε για την δημοσιοποίηση. Συνεχίζοντας την υιοθέτηση ιστορικά νευραλγικής σημασίας αρχών του UNIX, έτσι κι εμείς θα ακολουθήσουμε το “release early, release often”: όσο πιο νωρίς το ανακοινώσουμε τόσο πιο ποιοτικός θα είναι ο κώδικας μας, αλλά και τόσο πιο γρήγορα θα έρθουν τα άτομα στην παρέα (the more, the merrier), τα σχόλια, το testing, και (ας ελπίσουμε όχι στη δική μας περίπτωση) σύνδεσμοι σε άλλα έργα που κάνουν ακριβώς το ίδιο που θέλουμε. Με αυτά υπόψιν, στέλνουμε ένα μικρό email σε σχετικές ομάδες συζητήσεων που θα έχουν lurkers που μπορεί να ενδιαφέρονται στο έργο: στόχος μας, ξανά, είναι οι developers (κι όχι οι χρήστες).</p>
<p>Αυτό ήταν. Φυτεύουμε το σπόρο αυτό και ρόλος μας είναι να βοηθήσουμε το έργο να εξελιχτεί σε ένα ζωντανό οργανισμό. Από αυτό το σημείο και μετά, στους ρόλους του maintainer είναι κι αυτός του στοργικού κηπουρού, του ποιμένα και πατέρα.</p>

<p>Ακολουθούμε την παράδοση των Fedora release parties. Με αφορμή το Fedora 10 που βγαίνει στον αέρα σε μερικές ημέρες, βρισκόμαστε μαζί λινουξάδες του χωριού και των περιχώρων για να γνωριστούμε, να λύσουμε απορίες, να δούμε τα νεότερα από το leading edge του Linux.</p>
<p>Σε καμιά βδομάδα λοιπόν ο Χρήστος Μπαχαράκης (ο ήρωας πίσω από το σούπερ-επιτυχές Serres installfest) οργανώνει το Fedora 10 release party στη Θεσσαλονίκη. Θα έχουμε παρουσίαση των πλούσιων τεχνικών χαρακτηριστικών που μαγείρεψαν οι Fedora developers — τα οποία σε μερικούς μήνες θα κυλίσουν στις άλλες διανομές… <evil grin>. Μερικά από αυτά είναι blazingly fast startup (Plymouth), Glitch-free audio, Improved webcam support, Printing simplified, RPM 4.6, Ad-hoc network sharing, First Aid Kit Automated Recovery, VirtStorage, Sectool, GNOME 2.24, Netbeans, Openoffice 3.0, και <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/10/FeatureList">αρκετά άλλα</a>.</p>
<p>Α ναι, θα έχουμε και αρκετά αυτοκόλλητα που μας περίσσεψαν από το Athens Digital Week. =)</p>

		<li class="entry"><p>During <a href="http://spevack.livejournal.com/67628.html">Max’s days in Athens</a>, we had quite a few opportunities to engage in some really interesting discussions about Fedora and the open source ecosystem in general. Whether it was while walking on Acropolis, strolling through the market streets of Monastiraki, or eating a souvlaki, we talked about a bunch of topics like <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CommunityArchitecture">community architecture</a>, Fedora’s image to external users and developers, FUDCons, contribution locality and universality, and sponsoring.</p>
<p>A week later, Max <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Board/Elections/Nominations#Dimitris_Glezos_.28glezos.29">nominated me for the Fedora Board</a>. So it seems my ideas might not be <em>completely</em> absurd after all. There is also the possibility that Max had a drink or two from his big <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouzo">Ouzo</a> bottle before considering it.</p>
<p>Having participated in the decision-making cogs of the Localization and Documentation Projects, I experienced first-hand the change one can make in Fedora, should one want to improve something. Like, for example, <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/RFR/FinalElvisMove">moving software development</a> from an internal server to Fedora systems, building a <a href="http://transifex.org/">new translation platform</a>, and forming a <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/L10N/SteeringCommittee">team</a> to steer one of Fedora’s biggest sub-projects.</p>
<p>With these in mind, I decided to do something with my ideas and energy to improve our project on a global scale, and run for Fedora’s top-level decision team. I put down on the wiki page <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Board/Elections/Nominations#Dimitris_Glezos_.28glezos.29">a number of reasons</a> one could support my candidacy.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about me, my ideas (be it plans, thoughts on what we’re doing right or wrong, etc) or how you too could get your hands on some Ouzo, don’t hesitate to fire away an email, instant message, or find me on IRC.</p>
