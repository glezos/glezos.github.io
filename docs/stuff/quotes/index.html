<p>Πάντα μου άρεσαν τα quotes of wisdom και τα MOTD. Έτσι σκέφτηκα να μαζέψω μερικά που έχω κρατήσει και να τα ρίξω εδώ. Ακολουθούν λοιπόν διάφορα quotes που κάποια από αυτά αντανακλούν τέλεια την πραγματικότητα και κάποια άλλα απλά προκαλούν γέλιο με την δόση ειρωνίας που τα χαρακτηρίζει.</p>

<p>What came first, the music or the misery? People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos, that some sort of culture of violence will take them over.

<p>Youth must go, ah yes. But youth is only being in a way like it might be an animal. No, it is not just like being an animal so much as being like one of these malenky toys you viddy being sold in the streets, like little chellovecks made out of tin and with a spring inside and then a winding handle on the outside and you wind it up grrr grrr grrr grrr and off it itties, like walking, O my brothers.

Being young is like being like one of these malenky machines. -- Alex, A Clockwork Orange</p>
<p>But the not-self cannot have the bad, meaning they of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self. And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines? I am serious with you, brothers, over this. But what I do I do because I like to do. (Alex, A Clockwork Orange)</p>
<p>Alex's adventures are a kind of psychological myth. Our subconscious finds release in Alex, just as it finds release in dreams. It resents Alex being stifled and repressed by authority, however much our conscious mind recognizes the necessity of doing this. (Stanley Kubrick)</p>
<p>I know how things are now. Nobody wants or loves me. I've suffered and suffered and suffered and everybody wants me to go no suffering. I know. (Alex, A Clockwork Orange)</p>

<p>TAINT_NOT; /* Each statement is presumed innocent */ (From pp_nextstate in pp_hot.c, in the source for perl 5.6.0)</p>
<p>Fortunately our postmodern culture is based on the happy contradiction that any decent culture must be countercultural. If you can't deconstruct your own program, you aren't really with the program. (Larry Wall, "Uncultured Perl", <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/1999-10/uncultured_03.html">LINUX MAGAZINE</a>, October 1999)</p>
<p>Issac Newton: Albert... So do you still believe that God doesn't play dice? Albert Einstein: That quote isn't *relative* anymore. Lately, I've been thinking that God doesn't play Pokemon. (Nitrozac, <a href="http://www.geekculture.com/geekycomics/Aftery2k/y2Karchives/165.html">AFTER Y2K!</a>, 1 November 1999)</p>

<p>I want to be part of a certain kind of community in which people have certain freedoms. Community and freedom are primary, not business. A software industry can be a good thing, as long as it develops free software; but if our choice is between having the community and having a software industry, we should keep the community. (Richard M. Stallman, 10 August 1998)</p>
<p>When I first encountered C, things were simple. A number was a number, and a pointer was a pointer. When I had studied it a while, it became much more complex, with many rules to memorize. A number was a no longer a number, a pointer was no longer just a pointer. Now that I understand C, it is simple again. A number is a number. A pointer is a pointer. (The Zen of C)</p>
<p>If I had a pointer big enough, I could move the world. ((allegedly) Brain W. Kernighan)</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I found it mostly interesting in a Jerry Springer kind of way. White trash battling it out in public, throwing chairs at each other. SCO crying about IBM's other women. ... Fairly entertaining (Linus Torvalds, concerning SCO's lawsuit on IBM)</p>
<p>They are smoking crack. (Linus Torvalds, concerning SCO's lawsuit on IBM)</p>

<p>I would not think of quarreling with your interpretation nor offering any other, as I have found it always the best policy to allow the film to speak for itself. (Stanley Kubrick)</p>
<p>If you could see the you that I see, when I see you seeing me, you'd see yourself so differently...Believe me! (Henry Rollins, END OF SILENCE, "Low Self Opinion)</p>
