<p>In October 2010, we released Transifex 1.0. This release features a huge number
of improvements and possibilities, which open up new roads for our next
versions. At the same time, it introduces a number of changes to the user
workflow.</p>
<p>This page describes how some of the changes affect users and will help you
<a class="reference internal" href="#user-migrating-one-dot-zero"><em>migrate your workflow</em></a> to the new order of things.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-gist">
<h2>The Gist<a class="headerlink" href="#the-gist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For Transifex 1.0, the whole translation storage engine was written from
scratch. This meant the re-writing of more than 10 thousand lines of code.</p>
<p>The core goal is to migrate to a far more robust translation system, where
<strong>translations live in Transifex itself</strong> instead of files scattered around
repositories. This allows us to improve the workflow by offering more
flexibility for both developers and translators, improve quality with more
powerful features and enhance the efficiency of the translation process.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the major improvements:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Transifex&#8217;s native integration with Version Control Systems
has been replaced by a mechanism for automatic updates of the source
language file using HTTP, and a more secure command-line tool for project
maintainers and translators.</li>
<li>Resources have now replaced the obsolete notion of components,
which used to represent a VCS branch.</li>
<li>All operations are now done on a string-level, rather than a file-level,
allowing greater flexibility and more features like suggestions, comments,
translation memory, etc.</li>
<li>Tracking of source file changes now happen on top of HTTP, compared to the
previous VCS-only support. This allows the translation of any source file
hosted on any web server on the Internet.</li>
<li>Arbitrary translation of file types are now seamlessly supported, not just
PO files. Transifex 1.0 also comes with native support for Qt files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these changes may sound scary. They&#8217;re actually fun, keep reading. :-)</p>
<div class="section" id="how-does-this-affect-you">
<h3>How does this affect you?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-this-affect-you" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re a <strong>translator</strong>, this won&#8217;t affect you a bit. You will probably notice
a couple of new features available in the online web-based editor, which allow
you to translate more effectively and communicate better with your fellow
translators.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a <strong>developer</strong>, the biggest change is that Transifex will not
auto-commit translations. Instead, you can use a command-line tool to pull
the translations right before you need them, for example before a release
of your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advantages">
<h3>Advantages<a class="headerlink" href="#advantages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Security</strong>:
By removing the VCS integration we overcome one of the greater
obstacles and security risks that the previous version of Transifex had:
having write access to other people&#8217;s repositories. In addition, Transifex
does not even require <em>read</em> access to your VCS: you control when and how
files will be sent to Transifex and received back.</li>
<li><strong>Predictability</strong>:
Transifex had to jump through hoops to &#8220;talk&#8221; with some
VCSs. Sometimes a commit/push operation would fail because of
timeouts on the remote server, causing loss of translations. Now Transifex
has full control over the translations, and you have full control over the
final result.</li>
<li><strong>More languages</strong>:
By allowing you to directly control how local files are mapped to languages,
Transifex no longer restricts your translation file naming scheme and
directory structure. Your files may exist anywhere in your tree and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myproject.john-en2.po</span></tt> could map to English, like you always planned.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined builds</strong>:
Translation files are now <em>guaranteed</em> to be valid,
so no longer translators can accidentally break your package build.</li>
<li><strong>Versatility</strong>:
This file agnostic storage engine which works underneath
the layer of importers and exporters makes it much easier to add support for
multiple file formats without having to modify Transifex&#8217;s core.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Scalability</strong>:
The new approach enables to better handle large amounts of
strings and support projects which have thousands of strings marked for
translation.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>:
As the motto <em>Less is more</em> implies, quality doesn&#8217;t mean quantity. In this
release, we&#8217;ve made a major clean up of the existing code and the new design
of Transifex is dead simple and overly effective. This makes it much more
easier to extend Transifex with additional functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Major Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#major-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="overhaul-of-vcs-integration">
<h3>Overhaul of VCS integration<a class="headerlink" href="#overhaul-of-vcs-integration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Starting with version 1.0, the native integration of Transifex with version
control systems has been replaced by a more versatile approach using a client-side
command-line tool and a set of APIs to interact directly with Transifex.
Put bluntly, Transifex will not checkout/clone your whole repository to
calculate statistics and will not commit translations straight to your repository.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve introduced a number of other tools to help you work more efficiently with
Transifex. Let&#8217;s drill down to what actually changes. The following two
operations are important to Transifex:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Tracking source language files from the development repository</li>
<li>Integrating translations in a product&#8217;s release</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="source-language-file-tracking">
<h4>Source language file tracking<a class="headerlink" href="#source-language-file-tracking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Before 1.0, Transifex frequently and transparently fetched the source files
from the source repository with a checkout/pull. The whole repository
(sometimes hundred of MBs) was fetched.</p>
<p>Starting from 1.0, Transifex now stores an HTTP-like URL for each translatable
resource pointing to a single and specific source language file (e.g. an &#8216;en.po&#8217;
or &#8216;myproject.pot&#8217; file. Transifex frequently and transparently fetches this
file over HTTP with a simple HTTP GET request (a few KBs).</p>
<p>So, the &#8216;git pull&#8217; or &#8216;svn checkout&#8217; operation was replaced by a more simple
&#8216;HTTP GET&#8217; request. The end-result for the project maintainer is the same:
Transifex automatically detects source language string additions and deletions.</p>
<p>Please note that because of this design decision, intltool-based projects
which do not have a POT file are not supported. If your project is of this kind,
create a POT file using intltool, commit it to your repository, and proceed
as though your project is a Gettext-based one. For more information, please
refer to the <em class="xref std std-ref">related documenttion section</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="submitting-translations">
<h4>Submitting translations<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-translations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Before 1.0, the developer gave Transifex write access to his VCS repository,
and translations were automatically committed by Transifex. Each translation
task resulted in a VCS commit &amp; push.</p>
<p>Starting from 1.0, you can choose when and how to retrieve translations.
Translation files can be exported from Transifex with a handy command in your
terminal: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tx</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></tt>.</p>
<p>On a related note, you have full control over where your translations will live.
Here are three different options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You may house your translations on Transifex. To create a new project release,
you can fetch the files to a local directory of yours with the command-line
tool.</li>
<li>You may host your translation files in your repository, like you used to do.
Once per week, or whenever you feel like it, issue a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tx</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></tt> command and
commit all files in your repository. Or, even set up a cronjob to do exactly
this.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you may choose to host your translation files on a separate
repository from your project, or even on multiple repositories. For example,
if you are the manager of 50 projects, you may choose to put all translations
in a single repository for simplicity reasons. You have full control on where
your exported files will be put and how they&#8217;ll be committed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="components-replaced-by-resources">
<span id="user-components-resources"></span><h3>&#8216;Components&#8217; replaced by &#8216;Resources&#8217;<a class="headerlink" href="#components-replaced-by-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The word &#8216;component&#8217; will be phased out in favor of the more improved concept
of &#8216;resources&#8217;. For more information on Resources, please refer to the
section <em class="xref std std-ref">user-resources</em>.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is that while Components could refer to one or more
source language files (e.g. many POT files), Resources refer to a single
source file. This allows Transifex to better track the relationship between
files and manage the mapping between a source file and its translation files.</p>
<p>If your project has multiple source files, just create a separate translatable
resource for each. Translators will love you for it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="migrating-your-project">
<span id="user-migrating-one-dot-zero"></span><h2>Migrating your Project<a class="headerlink" href="#migrating-your-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Transifex.com has now been <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.transifex.com/2010/11/one-dot-zero/">upgraded to the newer version</a>. You should have
receive an email or seen the announcement about this a few days before the
upgrade, and received a newsletter from our team one right after the upgrade.</p>
<p>During the upgrade, the following will happen automatically to your project:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Your old Components will be converted to <strong>Resources</strong>. All related objects,
such as Releases and Hubs, will also point to the newly created Resources.</p>
<p>Transifex will try to name your resource in a unique way. You&#8217;ll most likely
need to rename your resources to something which makes more sense to you.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Each PO file you previously had in your Component, will now be <strong>imported</strong>
in your new Resource. For example, your &#8216;fr.po&#8217; file will be imported to the
French translation of your Resource.</p>
<p>PO files for which a language could not be guessed (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myfile.po</span></tt>) will
be skipped.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If your Component had multiple POT files, Transifex will create a <strong>separate
Resource for each POT</strong> file found.</p>
<p>If a PO file could not be mapped to a single POT, then it won&#8217;t be able to
be mapped to one of the new resources, and will be skipped.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Any fuzzy strings found in your PO files will be converted to <strong>suggestions</strong>
in the Transifex database. These are available to all translators in the
Online Web Editor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, your project should be ready. Translators can login to translate,
and you can export your files freely.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p><strong>Invalid source files</strong></p>
<p class="last">An exception to the above workflow is when Transifex could not read your POT
file. This might happen because it was incorrectly encoded or it was simply
broken. If this was the case, Transifex could not load the file, and you&#8217;ll
need to manually create your resource with a fresh, valid file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-your-local-settings">
<h3>Creating your local settings<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-your-local-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next time you&#8217;ll need to interact with Transifex is probably when you&#8217;d like
to export your translations to local files, which you&#8217;ll include in your new
project release.</p>
<p>Additionally, if one of the above steps failed (e.g. one of your files have not
been detected), you can manually fix them (something which was not possible
with the previous Transifex version).</p>
<p>You may find all information you need at the <a class="reference internal" href="../client/index.html#user-client"><em>Transifex Client</em></a>
section. Assuming you have a POT file named &#8216;po/myproject.pot&#8217;, here is a
sample run of the commands you could run at this point.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>myproject
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo easy_install -U transifex-client
<span class="nv">$ </span>tx init
<span class="nv">$ </span>tx <span class="nb">set</span> --auto-local -r myproject.myresource --source-language en <span class="se">\</span>
  --source-file <span class="s1">&#39;po/myproject.pot&#39;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;po/&lt;lang&gt;.po&#39;</span>
<span class="c"># (Review output...)</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>tx <span class="nb">set</span> --auto-local -r myproject.myresource --source-language<span class="o">=</span>en <span class="se">\</span>
  --source-file <span class="s1">&#39;po/myproject.pot&#39;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;po/&lt;lang&gt;.po&#39;</span> --execute
<span class="nv">$ </span>tx status

<span class="c"># Pull fresh translation files from Transifex:</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>tx pull

<span class="c"># To notify Transifex of new source strings available, run:</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>tx push --source
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If your source language file is following the same pattern (e.g. it is named
&#8216;po/en.po&#8217;), you can omit the &#8216;-source-file&#8217; argument.</p>
<p>If you face any issues with your project migration, don&#8217;t hesitate to drop by
IRC, on the #transifex channel on FreeNode, and ask away.</p>

<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h2>Rationale<a class="headerlink" href="#rationale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Transifex started a few years ago as a web-based VCS File Submission
tool. It had a perfect match with translator&#8217;s needs and found its niche
application. It was written in a whole different Python framework, TurboGears,
and things were good.</p>
<p>One year later, we shifted gears: We added translation
statistics support and re-wrote the whole tool in Django. This marked a
big step for us, and the evolution of Transifex to a translation
management platform. Since then, some very big open-source projects
have switched to Transifex [1], some of them working really close with
our team to develop features in an astonishing speed.</p>
<p>It was time to switch gears again.</p>
<p>Previously, translations were handled on a file-based level. This has served
us well in the past. While it was intuitive and bound well with how
developers were doing things, it was also very limiting and didn&#8217;t reflect well
how translators were doing things.</p>
<p>With the new translation storage engine, functions like merging translations,
handling file encoding, searching, grouping translations, splitting the
work among translators, performing and packaging translations across projects
are now possible.</p>
<p>The feedback we&#8217;ve received from our most active users was very positive. We&#8217;ve
also ironed out the biggest issues, and found an almost seamless upgrade
mechanism. This, along with the sheer motivation to build a better translation
platform, were all we needed to go forward.</p>
<p>Translators shouldn&#8217;t notice most of these changes. Developers will have a small
change in their workflow, but we&#8217;ve got them covered with our new tools. They
should also feel more comfortable since Transifex no longer requires access
to their VCS repository.</p>

<h3>Have you removed VCS support altogether?<a class="headerlink" href="#have-you-removed-vcs-support-altogether" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yes and No. Translation files can still be committed in the versioning system,
but Transifex is not doing that automatically. Additionally, Transifex can
still track changes to your POT files using a web-accessible URL (instead of
cloning the whole repo).</p>

<h3>Why, why, WHY? I&#8217;m scared.<a class="headerlink" href="#why-why-why-i-m-scared" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t! The new version does not enforce you to remove your files from
the VCS if you want them there. Just create a Makefile rule, cronjob,
post-commit hook to do it automatically using the client. This gives you full
control on where and how your files will be placed.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re dedicated in providing the best translation management platform out there.
By trusting translations to live inside Transifex, we can do things which were
not possible before.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re more committed than ever to continue improving Transifex and adding
more functionality. Our team is growing, and the best is yet to come!</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>There was no source language file (POT). Transifex could not find the

<li>Your POT file was invalid. Invalid files are those which do not pass the
