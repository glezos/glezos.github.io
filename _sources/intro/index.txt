 Introduction
==============

Transifex_ is a novel web application for localization in an easy, agile,
and hassle-free way. Transifex was designed from the ground-up for **dynamic,
frequently-published content** consolidated from multiple sources, such as
software, documentation, websites, and news publication.

Transifex seamlessly integrates with existing content infrastructure, such as a
software development repository or content management system, using a rich API.
Translation is "crowd-sourced" to a global network of human translators using
smart and agile translation techniques adopted from the open source ecosystem.

This guide will bring examples from software localization, however most
notions and workflows apply to arbitrary content localization as well.


Localization 101
================

*(This section contains text from the awesome related articles of Wikipedia.)*

Localization is the second phase of a larger process of product translation
and cultural adaptation (for specific countries, regions, or groups) to account
for differences in distinct markets, a process known as internationalisation
and localisation.

Language localisation is not merely a translation activity, because it
involves a comprehensive study of the target culture in order to correctly
adapt the product to local needs. Localisation is sometimes referred to by
the numeronym "L10N" (as in: "L", followed by ten more letters, and then "N").

First, a software application is designed in a way so that it *can* be
adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.
This is a developer task, which enables a product to be used with multiple
scripts and cultures (globalization) and separating user interface resources
in a localizable format.

The localisation process is most generally related to the cultural adaptation
and translation of software, video games, and websites, and less frequently
to any written translation (which may also involve cultural adaptation
processes). Localisation can be done for regions or countries where people
speak different languages, or where the same language is spoken: for instance,
different dialects of Spanish, with different idioms, are spoken in Spain than
are spoken in Latin America; likewise, word choices and idioms vary among
countries where English is the official language (e.g., in the United States,
the United Kingdom, and the Philippines).


Coding practice
---------------

The current prevailing practice is for applications to place text in resource
strings which are loaded during program execution as needed. These strings,
stored in resource files, are relatively easy to translate. Programs are often
built to reference resource libraries depending on the selected locale data.
One software library that aids this is **gettext**.

Thus to get an application to support multiple languages one would design the
application to select the relevant language resource file at runtime. Resource
files are translated to the required languages. This method tends to be
application-specific and, at best, vendor-specific. The code required to
manage date entry verification and many other locale-sensitive data types also
must support differing locale requirements. Modern development systems and
operating systems include sophisticated libraries for international support of
these types.


Challenges
----------

Traditional localization solutions, such as translation offices, in-house
translators and others work well with content which is rarely updated, such as
books, traditional products, advertisements and others. However, in the world
of technology and the Internet, where content is updated very frequently,
Transifex offers a number of advantages:

* Faster release cycles, enabling mobile apps and websites to be released in
  a weekly-to-monthly basis instead of a yearly one.

* Short translation periods, by crowdsourcing to a wider audience the
  localization effort.
