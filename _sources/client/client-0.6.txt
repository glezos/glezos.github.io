=======================
 Transifex Client v0.6
=======================

.. note::

  This page describes :ref:`Transifex Client v0.6 <user-client-06-whats-new>`.  There are also
  docs for the :ref:`development version <user-client-devel>` and
  :ref:`older releases <user-client-releases>`.

.. _Transifex.com: https://www.transifex.com/

Released:
  20 December 2011

The Transifex Command-line Client is a command line tool that enables
you to easily manage your translations within a project without the
need of an elaborate UI system.

You can use the command-line client to easily create new resources,
map locale files to translations and synchronize your Transifex
project with your local repository and vice verca. Translators and
localization managers can also use it to handle large volumes of
translation files easily and without much hassle.

   :class: shot2 alcenter

If your distribution or operating system does not include a package
for transifex-client, please refer to the section
:ref:`user-client-06-install`.

**Notice**: This version of Transifex Client is fully compatible with Transifex.com_ and requires Transifex 1.2.



Using the client
================

To make sure that transifex-client was installed correctly, try running it
with the following command::

    tx --help

If everything was completed, then you should see a brief help message
and basic instructions on how to use the tool. You can also view the
available commands by running::

    tx help

To get more information for each command you can use ``tx help *command*``.


Command list
============

A brief introduction to the most commonly used commands provided by
transifex-client follows.

.. _user-client-06-init:

init
----

The ``tx init`` command is used to initialize a project.

This is very similar to the way most :term:`VCS` systems treat the init
command. Use this command to create a new project in the current directory.
This way you will be able to manage all translation files of the project that
exist under the project's root directory.

Here's a sample run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ tx init
  Creating .tx folder...
  Transifex instance [https://www.transifex.com]:
  Creating skeleton...
  Creating config file...
  No configuration file found.
  No entry found for host http://www.transifex.com. Creating...
  Please enter your transifex username: user
  Password: <...>
  Updating /home/username/.transifexrc file...
  Done.

.. note::

  It's safer to use encrypted http instead of plain http in order to avoid
  having your user credentials crossing the wire out in the open. Make sure
  that you use ``https`` over ``http`` whenever it is available.

Where to run init from
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may run this command from anywhere on your filesystem. It will basically
create a small file which stores the mapping between your local files and
Transifex resources.

If you have a software project in VCS and would like to commit this config
file, in order to make it available to anyone who clones your repository, run
the command in the root directory of your repo.

You might be managing multiple projects and would like a single configuration
file. This is common with translators, who use the client to manage their
contributions across projects. In this case, you may run this command outside
of the git repos.

.. note::

  If you want to automate the project initialization, the init command
  offers some options to set the default host, username and password so that
  you can use it with `non-interactive` scripts. For more info check the help
  page of the command (``'tx help init'``).


set
---

``tx set [options]``

This command is an aggregation of all functions needed to initialize and setup
a local Tx project either with by using local files or remote files directly
from the Transifex server.


auto-remote
~~~~~~~~~~~

``tx set --auto-remote <url>``

The command above can be used to initialize a local project for the remote
**Project**, **Release** or **Resource** specified by the url. Then you can
pull or push translation files from and to the server as usual. The supported
urls are the following:

+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Type     | URL                                                         | Description                                     |
+==========+=============================================================+=================================================+
| Resource | http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/transifex/resource/txo/ | Set up a single resource.                       |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Project  | http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/transifex/              | Set up all resources under this project.        |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Release  | http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/transifex/r/tx-1_0/     | Set up all resources belonging to this release. |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

The above URLs are for the Transifex project itself. You will have to
replace *transifex*, *txo* and *tx-1_0* for your project.


auto-local
~~~~~~~~~~

``tx set --auto-local -r <project.resource> '<expr>' --source-lang en [--source-file <file>]``

This command can be used to automatically initialize a Tx project by
using local files. The project must already exist on the Transifex
server, so if you haven't already created it, login to the web
interface and do so.

* **project.resource**: Your project and resource 'slugs', separated
  by a dot.  These are the strings found on your project's URL and
  together they uniquely identify your translatable resource. For
  example, if you have a URL such as
  www.transifex.com/projects/p/myproject/resource/myresource/, the
  unique slug will be "myproject.myresource".

* **source_lang**: This is the source language of your resource, such
  as 'en' for English. This is the language you selected, when you
  created your project at Transifex.

* **expr**: An expression which reflects the file/directory structure
  of your translation files. The expression must be in quotes and contain the
  ``'<lang>'`` keyword, for example: ``translations/po/<lang>.po``.

* If your source file doesn't follow that schema, you can specify a
  custom path for the source file using the ``'--source-file file'``
  option.

For instance, let's say you have a class open-source git-hosted
Gettext-i18nized project. Here's a set of commands you might use to
create a resource off your master branch::

  $ git clone http://git.example.com/git/myproject.git
  $ cd myproject
  $ tx init
  $ tx set --auto-local -r myproject.master 'po/<lang>.po' --source-lang en \
    --source-file po/myproject.pot
  $ tx push -s -t
  Pushing 'el' translations (file: po/el.po)
  Pushing 'gu' translations (file: po/gu.po)
  Pushing 'mr' translations (file: po/mr.po)

There is no requirement for your pot file name to match your resource
name, but the consistency might benefit others who come along later.

.. note::

  Keep in mind that the ``--auto-local`` option overwrites your
  existing ``.tx/config`` file.



Other set commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``tx set --source -r <project.resource> -l <lang> <file>``

This command simply sets the source file and the source language of a
specific resource. It can be used to initialize new resources or
update existing ones.

``tx set -r <project.resource> -l <lang> <file>``

This command can be used to set individual translation files mapped to
a certain language. This is useful when your translation files don't
use a common naming schema and the ``--auto-local`` command cannot be
used.


status
------

``tx status``

This is a simple command that displays the existing project
configuration in a more human readable format. It lists all resources
that have been initialized under the local project and all their
associated translation files.

Sample output::

    $ tx status
    myproject -> default (1 of 1)
    Translation Files:
     - en: po/smolt.pot (source)
     - ar: po/ar.po
     - as: po/as.po
     - bg: po/bg.po
     - bn_IN: po/bn_IN.p
     ...

push
----

``tx push``

This command sends local changes to the Transifex server. If you have
added new source files, the corresponding resources are created on the
Transifex server and, if you have new translations, those will get
pushed as well. This can also be used to update existing source files
or translations on the server with new strings.

When pushing source files, Transifex will update the source strings of a
resource to match those from the new source file. This operation may result in
loss of information, so please pay extra attention when pushing a source file.
This is the reason why ``--source`` isn't enabled by default.

Here's how differences between the old and new source files will be handled:

- New strings will be added.
- Modified strings will be considered new ones and added as well.
- Strings which do not exist in the new source file (including ones
  which have been modified) will be removed from the database, along
  with their translations.

Keep in mind, however, that old translations are kept in the
:ref:`Translation Memory <translation_memory>` of your project.

.. note::

  By default, Transifex will try to guess when the pushed files are
  not changed and it will skip them. To force the push operation, you
  should use the ``--force`` option.


pull
----

``tx pull``

This command updates your local files by pulling the latest translations
from the server as well as new translation files that were created in
the Transifex UI. By default, this command will check if the modification time
of your local files is more recent than that on the Transifex server and will
not overwrite newer files. If you want to force the download of specific
files, use the ``--force`` option.


Configuration files
===================

Configuration options for Transifex Client follow standard UNIX
practices, also adopted by Version Control System tools. The
configuration files the ``transifex-client`` is using are simple text
files that you can edit by hand. In this section, we will go over the
structure of each configuration file, so that if you need to edit a
file by hand, you'll know what to look for.

The ``transifex-client`` is using two basic configuration files.

transifexrc
-----------

``~/.transifexrc`` is unique per user and stores the hostname,
username and password for every Transifex server that you are
using. It is stored in the user's home directory.

.. code-block:: ini

    [https://www.transifex.com]
    username = user
    token =
    password = p@ssw0rd
    hostname = http://www.transifex.com

    [https://myproject.transifex.com]
    username = user2
    token =
    password = p@ssw0rd2
    hostname = http://www.transifex.com

If you change your password on a Transifex server for example, you
should edit this file with the new password. The ``token`` variable
should be left blank.


txconfig
--------

``transifex-client`` also uses a per project configuration file to
store the project's details and the file-to-resource mappings. This
file is stored in ``.tx/config`` of your project's root directory. It
has the following outline:

.. code-block:: ini

  [main]
  host = http://www.transifex.com

  [project_slug.resource_slug]
  file_filter = po/<lang>.po
  source_file = po/myproj.pot
  source_lang = en
  trans.fi = translations/fi/LC_MESSAGES/django.po

A quick rundown of the sections and options appearing in the config
file follows.

* **[main] section**

  In this section we have project-wide options, such as the default
  transifex host for all projects. These can be overriden by each
  resource, in case it is needed.

* **[project_slug.resource_slug]**

  * *source_lang*: this is the source language of the resource.
  * *source_file*: this points to the source file directly.
  * *file_filter*: here we hold the expression used to identify translation files under the specific project. [not mandatory]
  * *trans.<lang>*: this is used for translation files that don't follow a common naming schema and the file expression cannot be used to track them. [not mandatory]
  * *host*: in case the project doesn't use the default Transifex server as specified in the **[main] section**, it can override it using this option. [not mandatory]

So if you ever need to change the language of a file or correct the
file path for a specific translation, you can edit this file directly.

Apart from the above options, the following options are supported,
too, either at the *main* section or the *resource* section.

* *type*: The i18n type of the resource. See section :ref:`user-client-06-type`.

* *minimum_perc*: The minimum percentage a translation must be completed up to for the client to consider, whether it should pull it or not.


.. warning:: Transifex does not offer a way to revert your ``config``
    configuration back after some unsuccessful changes. So, make sure
    you backup the original file before editing by hand.


.. _user-client-06-type:

Defining the resource type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transifex natively supports a number of :ref:`user-formats file formats`,
also referred to as resource types. While Transifex does its best to guess
your file type based on the file extension and contents, it ultimately
requires you to define the resource type.

In the client, this is configured with the line 'type=' in the config file::

    $ cat .tx/config
    [myproject.myresource]
    file_filter = locale/<lang>.po
    source_file = locale/en_GB.po
    source_lang = en_GB
    type = PO

For a list of the available resource types, please refer to :ref:`user-formats`.

.. _user-client-06-mapping:

Customizing the language mappings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transifex by default uses certain language codes as they're described by
`ISO 639-1 <http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php>`_.
Since a lot of projects have their own mappings and are using different
language codes than the ones described by the ISO standard, the
``transifex-client`` offers a quick and easy way to setup your custom
one-to-one language mappings.

In order to setup a custom language mapping, you need to edit the
``.tx/config`` file by hand and add a ``lang_map`` section containing
a comma separated list of language mappings in the following way:

.. code-block:: ini

  lang_map = REMOTE_CODE:LOCAL_CODE

An example of a real language mapping is the following:

.. code-block:: ini

  lang_map = el: el_GR, sr@latin:sr_latin

Furthermore, you can combine global mappings, which apply to all
resources and are placed in the ``[main]`` section of your
configuration file, with resource specific language mappings, which
extend the global mapping with the local ones. A sample config file
follows:

.. code-block:: ini

  [main]
  host = https://www.transifex.com
  lang_map = el: el-GR, de: de-DE

  [foo.bar]
  file_filter = translations/foo.bar/<lang>.po
  source_lang = en
  lang_map = fr: fr-FR

  [foo.bar2]
  file_filter = translations/foo.bar2/<lang>.po
  host = http://localhost:8000
  source_lang = en
  lang_map = el: el_GR, ja: ja-JP

.. note:: The language mapping supports only one-to-one relations and it will
  not work with many-to-one setups.

For example, given the above configuration, one would pull the Greek
translations with the command

.. code-block:: bash

  tx pull -l el


Managing your project
=====================

For information regarding projects and what they represent, check
:ref:`the appropriate documentation <user-projects>`.


Creating a project
------------------

Currently, the client doesn't support creating a project directly from
the command line. So, you first have to visit the project creation
page at Transifex and fill out the corresponding form. Once you have
created your project, the only thing you need is the project
slug. This is part of the project details page URL (usually it is in
the following format:
``https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/<project_url>/``).

Once you have a project created on the Transifex site, go into your
project's root directory and run the ``tx init`` command. This will
initialize your local project and will create all necessary
configuration files. Once this is finished you are ready to go on to
the next step....


Managing your translations
--------------------------

Automatic setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transifex-client offers a smart and easy way to automatically setup
and track your translation files provided that all of them have a
common naming schema.  If for example, you have all translation files
under a directory structure similar to this::

  po/en.po
  po/de.po
  po/el.po
  po/fi.po
  po/ar.po

then, you could use an expression to group them together like
``'po/<lang>.po``.

The transifex-client can keep track of multiple files by using
expressions like the one above with the special keyword
``<lang>``. This keyword denotes where the language code is specified
in the file path. So, in order to quickly setup your project, you just
issue the following command::

  tx set -r <project_slug>.<resource_slug> -s en 'po/<lang>.po'

Even if you're using separate source files for translations (for
example, POT based projects) you can specify the source file on the
command above using the ``-f <file>`` option like this::

  tx set -r <project_slug>.<resource_slug> -s en -f <file> 'po/<lang>.po'

After that, you should have the translation files of your project
under tx management. The benefits of this approach compared to
handling one by one the translation files is that you can add/remove
files dynamically without having to edit the configuration files of
transifex-client. Also, the file pattern provides an easy way for
transifex-client to guess, where new translations should be saved when
downloaded from the server.

.. note::

  Even if you're using the automatic way of setting up your project, you
  can setup specific translation files that don't match the global
  expression as exceptions by using the manual way to setup translation
  files. This is described in the next part.

Manual setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases, the automatic setup procedures should cover most
scenarios but there are always people who prefer to do it the hard
way. The ``transifex-client`` offers a way to use static mapping
between locales and files, which may be what you need, if your
translation files don't share a common naming scheme.

So, in order to setup your project, you first need to create a
resource with an assigned source file. To do this, you should run the
following command::

    tx set --source -r <project_slug>.<resource_slug> -l <language> source_file

.. note::

  The resource name cannot contain special characters. The only valid
  characters are alphanumeric, the hyphen and the underscore.

Once you have created a mapping between a source file and a resource,
you should add more translations to this resource. To do this simply
run the following for every language::

    tx set -r <project_slug>.<resource_slug> -l <language> translation_file

After doing this for all available languages, you can check the
existing mapping using the ``tx status`` command.

Look also at the `multiple POT case example`_ for how to manually
setup your project in case it uses multiple pot files.


Pull/Push
~~~~~~~~~

When you are sure that the mapping is correct, you can push your files
to the Transifex server using the ``tx push`` command. The first time
you push a project to Transifex you should use the ``-s|--source``
flag with the ``push`` command, in order to push the source file. If
you want to push the translation files as well you should use the
``-t|--translations`` in addition to the ``-s`` flag. By using the
``-s`` flag, the Transifex server will create a corresponding resource
to each pushed source file, if one does not exist on the server. On
consecutive pushes, you may omit this flag and only include it
whenever you want to update the source strings of your resource.

.. note::

  In case the resource does not already exist in Transifex, you should
  set the option ``type`` in your ``.tx/config`` file to denote the
  type of resource you have. This option can go either in the *main*
  section of the file (so that it applies to all resources) or in the
  section of the resource.


Whenever you have done some work in the online translation editor on
Transifex (lote) and you want to incorporate those changes back into
your project, you can simply run ``tx pull``. If you also want to pull
new translation files, you can add the ``'-a|--all'`` flag to the
``pull`` command. You should keep in mind, however, that if you
have not setup your project by using a file expression, you need to
move and track the new translation files manually after downloading
them.

If you are interested in only a subset of the available resources of
your project, you can use the ``-r/--resource`` option to push/pull
files only for the specific (comma-separated) resources. You can also
use Unix shell-style wildcards to easily select multiple resources.

Additionally, there is an option to work only on specific
(comma-separated) languages, the ``-l/--language`` option.


.. note:: Depending on the size of the files and the number of
    languages, this process can take up to several minutes, as it
    requires uploading all files, parsing them, extracting the
    available strings and storing them into the database.  To avoid
    misuse of the API, we have some throttling mechanisms in play,
    which should not interfere with your work. However, just to be
    safe, whenever pushing or pulling to/from the Transifex server, if
    you want a specific resource or language use the ``-r/--resource``
    and ``-l/--language`` options of the ``push``/``pull`` commands to
    avoid pushing/pulling all of the tracked files.


Delete
~~~~~~

Transifex-client is also able to delete translations for a
resource. The ``delete`` command supports deleting both a specific
translation of a resource as well as all translations of the resource.

In case there is a team for a language or the translation is not
empty, then the ``delete`` command only displays a warning,
instructing the user to use the ``-f`` option, should he want to
actually delete the translation.


.. _user-client-06-sample-usage:


Sample Usage
============


For Developers
--------------

Let's assume you are the maintainer of the Transifex project itself,
and you want to setup your project to use Transifex for
translations. First of all, navigate to your project's main directory,
such as your VCS directory root.  Then, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx init
  Creating .tx folder...
  Transifex instance [http://www.transifex.com]:
  Creating skeleton...
  Creating config file...
  No configuration file found.
  No entry found for host http://www.transifex.com. Creating...
  Please enter your transifex username: user
  Password:
  Updating /home/user/.transifexrc file...
  Done.

To ask Transifex to detect your files automatically, run the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx set --auto-local -r transifex.txo  -s en 'po/<lang>.po'
  Only printing the commands which will be run if the --execute switch is specified.

  tx set --source -r transifex.txo -l en po/en.po

  tx set -r transifex.txo -l bal po/bal.po
  tx set -r transifex.txo -l bn_IN po/bn_IN.po
  tx set -r transifex.txo -l ca po/ca.po
  tx set -r transifex.txo -l cs po/cs.po
  tx set -r transifex.txo -l da po/da.po
  ...
  Done.



If everything looks good, issue the command again with the
``--execute`` switch:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx set --auto-local -r transifex.txo  -s en 'po/<lang>.po' --execute
  Updating source for resource transifex.txo ( en -> po/en.po ).
  Setting source file for resource transifex.txo ( en ->   po/en.po ).
  Updating file expression for resource transifex.txo ( po/<lang>.po ).
  Done.


Finally, here's a sample run with manual mapping of your files:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx --traceback set --source -r transifex.txo -l en po/en.po
  Setting source file for resource transifex.txo ( en -> po/en.po ).
  Done.

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx --traceback set -r transifex.txo -l el po/el.po
  Updating translations for resource transifex.txo ( el -> po/el.po ).
  Done.


After that, once your mapping is done, you can push or pull freely to
the Transifex server. If it is the first time you are setting up your
project, you should probably push your files to the Transifex server
with the following command:


.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx push --source --translations
  Pushing translations for resource transifex.txo:
  Pushing source file (po/en.po)
  Pushing 'el' translation (file: po/el.po).
  Pushing 'hu' translation (file: po/hu.po).
  Pushing 'zh_TW' translation (file:  po/zh_TW.po).
  ...
  Pushing 'te' translations (file: po/te.po)
  Pushing 'pl' translations (file: po/pl.po)
  Done.

Then, you can visit the Transifex server and view the available
translations from the web UI. Let's say, you translate your project
into more languages and just before the new release, you want to
update the translations. In that case, this is what you should do:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/transifex]$ tx pull -a
  Pulling translations for resource transifex.txo (source:
  po/en.po)
  New translations found for the following languages: nb, tg, xh
  Pulling 'el' translation (file: po/el.po).
  Pulling 'hu' translation (file: po/hu.po).
  Pulling 'zh_TW' translation (file:  po/zh_TW.po).
  Pulling 'bn_IN' translation (file:  po/bn_IN.po).
  ...
  Pulling 'te' translation (file: po/te.po).
  Pulling 'pl' translation (file: po/pl.po).
  Pulling new translations for source file po/en.po
   -> nb: ./po/nb.po
  Done.

Notice the 'nb' language: the new translation file is now managed by
Transifex, which means that in subsequent pushes/pulls this will be
updated as well.


.. _multiple POT case example:

Keep in mind that, in case your project uses multiple POT files (or
any other kind of file), each POT file will become a separate
resource. If they are two, just run two set commands. With the next
push, both of them will be pushed. If they are too many, you can
create a small script to replace the 'set' commands similar to this:

.. code-block:: bash

  for POTFILE in `ls pot/`; do
    tx set --auto-local -r <project>.$POTFILE --source-language=en \
    --source-file pot/$POTFILE.pot "<lang>/$POTFILE.po" --execute
  done

The above snippet assumes that the POT files are in a directory called
``pot`` and all PO files are grouped under a directory named after the
language they are for (``<lang>/<file>.po``). Also, that the name of
the project is ``project``.


For Translators
---------------

If you are a translator, you don't really care for all the files
included in a project but just the actual translation files. To make
the workflow for translators easier, transifex-client offers the
ability to initialize a local project by getting the translation files
of a project directly from the Transifex server instead of the
project's VCS.

So, in order to begin, you must first create a folder and ``cd`` into
it. Then you run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    [user@host:~/trans-project]$ tx init
    Creating .tx folder...
    Transifex instance [http://www.transifex.com]:
    Creating skeleton...
    Creating config file...
    No configuration file found.
    No entry found for host http://www.transifex.com. Creating...
    Please enter your transifex username: user
    Password:
    Updating /home/user/.transifexrc file...
    Done.

    [user@host:~/trans-project]$ tx set --auto-remote  http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/transifex/
    Auto configuring local project from remote URL...
    Getting details for project transifex
    2 resources found. Configuring...
    Configuring resource txo.
    Configuring resource meegotouch.
    Done.

Now, you should be ready to pull the translation files for the
resources of this project. To do it, simply run the ``pull`` command
with the ``-a|--all`` flag set:

.. code-block:: bash

  [user@host:~/testpo]$ tx pull -a
  Pulling translations for resource transifex.txo (source: None)
  New translations found for the following languages: bal, bn_IN, ca, zh_CN,
  zh_TW, cs, da, nl, en_GB, et, fr, gl, de, he, hu, id, it, ja, lv, ms, nb, pa,
  fa, pl, pt, pt_BR, ro, ru, sr, sk, es, sv, tg, te, uk, xh
  Skipping 'el' translation (file: translations/transifex.txo/el.po).
  Skipping 'sq' translation (file: translations/transifex.txo/sq.po).
  Pulling new translations for source file None
   -> bal: ./translations/transifex.txo/bal.po
   -> bn_IN: ./translations/transifex.txo/bn_IN.po
   ...
   -> te: ./translations/transifex.txo/te.po
   -> uk: ./translations/transifex.txo/uk.po
   -> xh: ./translations/transifex.txo/xh.po
  Done.

Now you can translate any of these files using your preferred editor
and push it back to the server.

.. note::

  The url we used above is a project url which tells transifex-client
  to configure all available resources under this specific
  project. Instead of a project url, you can pass a resource or a
  release url to the ``tx`` command and it will auto-setup a specific
  resource or all resources under the specified release. The workflow
  is similar in all cases.


.. _user-client-06-whats-new:

What's new in version 0.6?
==========================

New features
------------

* Deleting translations from the client is now possible with the
  ``delete`` command. See ``tx help delete`` for more information.
* Added command-line option ``--minimum-perc`` and configuration
  option ``minimum_perc`` to specify the minimum percentage a resource
  must have been translated in a language for the client to consider,
  when pulling translations.
* Add debug messages and corresponding option (``-d``).
* Support wildcards in command-line to make easier to select resources.



Enhancements
------------

* The client is no longer tied to a particular set of
  formats. Instead, it gets an updated list from the server, whenever
  it is needed. This way, the client will support new formats as soon
  as they are added to Transifex.
* A test suite has been added. As a result, it is easier to modify the
  client and add new features.
* The client uses the new API of Transifex.
* A lot of unnecessary API calls were removed, so that the client is
  now faster.


Bugfixes
--------

- Allow the '-' character in hostnames the user defines.
- ``--auto-remote`` option works for releases with outsourced projects, too.
- Check whether the ``.tx`` directory exists and report an error
  message, if not.
- Always read and write translation files as binary (needed to support
  Windows).
- Don't throw an error, when a resource has a dot in its slug.
- If the user does not select a protocol (http or https), when
  initializing a project, use https.


.. _user-client-06-install:

Getting the client
==================


Latest stable version
---------------------

The Transifex Client can be found on various places, including your system's
software repositories. For example, in Fedora, you should be able to install it
by running::

    (sudo) sudo yum install transifex-client

The client is also available at the Python Package Index (PYPI). To install it,
make sure you have a recent version of setuptools installed and then issue the
following command::

    (sudo) easy_install --upgrade transifex-client

This command will install the latest version of transifex-client and if
you have an outdated version it'll perform an update.


Development version
-------------------

You can also get transifex-client directly from the development source
code repository. You can download the repository either using Mercurial::

  $ git clone git@github.com:transifex/transifex-client.git

or by directly downloading the 'tip' version in zip or tarball form from
the `repository web front-end <http://code.transifex.com/transifex-client/downloads>`_.

To install it, simply use ``setuptools`` as follows::

  $ cd transifex-client
  (sudo) python setup.py install


Installing without root access
------------------------------

It's also possible to install the client on systems on which you don't have
superuser access usinv virtualenv.

1. Install virtualenv:

   Now, here we have a little chicken & egg problem, because to install
   virtualenv, you either need root access, or you need to install it below
   your home directory and make Python find it. The good thing is, you don't
   need to install virtualenv to use it, you can just run the the script
   directly from the directory where you unpacked the distriution.

   If you want to install virtualenv and can live with gaining root
   privileges just once for this occasion, then do the following::

     $ sudo easy_install virtualenv
     # OR something like: sudo yum install python-virtualenv

   If you can't or don't want to install it as root, follow these steps:

   1. Download ``virtualenv-X.Y.tar.gz`` from the virtualenv_ PyPI page.
   2. Unpack the tarball.
   3. In step two below, substitute ``virtualenv`` with the full path to the
      virtualenv.py script located in the directory you just unpacked.

2. Create & activate a new environment::

     $ virtualenv </path/to/new/environment>
     $ source </path/to/new/environment>/bin/activate

3. Install the client using setuptools::

     easy_install --upgrade transifex-client

Windows version
---------------

In case you use windows, there is a version of the transifex client
for windows, too. You can download the latest 0.6 version from
http://files.transifex.com/transifex-client/0.6/tx.exe. This
executable is standalone and does not need to be installed.

.. note::

  Make sure you use backslashes ('\\') in the path instead of slashes
  ('/') in the configuration file ``.tx/config``.

To use it, you should download it in the folder of your project. Then,
you have to open the ``cmd`` program that comes bundled with windows
and give the command::

  cd \path\to\project\

Now you can use the client as described in the rest of the
document. An example session is presented in the following image.
