What's new in Transifex 1.1
===========================


Improved Performance
--------------------

A much wanted improvement comes in the form of denormalized statistics.
Transifex 1.1 boosts performance between 4x-10x on various pages on the
interface, especially the ones showing statistics, which should now load in
milliseconds.

The various statistics for each resource or release are available in real time, 
no matter how large your project is. Together with smarter statistics update
algorithms, the performance gain should be obvious.

Native support for Joomla INI and Java .property files
------------------------------------------------------

Joomla extensions and themes are managed using special
:ref:`INI files <joomla-ini-files>`, which can now be loaded in Transifex and
handled natively. This means that these resources behave exactly like any other,
with full support of all features, including the web-based editor, Transifex
client, etc. No need to convert to PO or another intermediate format.

Additionally, :ref:`Java .property files <java-property-files>` are now
supported natively as well.

Just create a new resource by uploading the INI or ``.property`` file and a
resource should be created right away. Support or even more file formats is
on the way.


Fussy re-using of existing strings in source language files
-----------------------------------------------------------

A new feature that was added in this version is the fuzzy matching of source
strings when importing new source files. This enables Transifex to identify
similar source strings and use the existing translations as suggestions for
newly added source strings. This is especially useful when updating the source
strings of a resource and most of the changes are minor corrections since you
can still use your existing translations with minor tweaking.

The similarity threshold is configurable in the settings files, although we
expect most projects to keep the default value.


Integration of L10n instructions URL in the project details page
----------------------------------------------------------------

Another new feature that the new Transifex version offers is the ability to
define a URL containing L10n instructions for a project. This will be linked
from the Project Details page and can include documentation for translators,
packagers, other developers etc. Useful to link against wiki pages of a project.


Support for language codes alongside language-country codes
-----------------------------------------------------------

Several languages available in Transifex with aliases pointing to countries, as
for example 'es' pointing to 'es_ES' now were split into two different
languages. It allows the projects registered on Transifex to choose whenever
they want to use only general language code ('es') or language code plus country
info ('es_ES'), depending on the code style used by the system.


Application Programming Interface version 2
-------------------------------------------

The :ref:`new revised API <tech-api-v2>` is a simpler, more elegant and more
consistent version of the Transifex API.

The most important feature is the merge between the
StorageHandler, the ProjectResourceHandler and the ResourceHandler into one
unified ResourceHandler. This gives you the ability to create a resource and
push its content with a single request. Furthermore, the Translation Handler now
also accepts json-encoded strings, empowering you to send the translations along
with other information in one request.

The URLs of the new API are under
**/api/2** while the old API still resides in **/api**. The old API can also be
accessed under **/api/1**. This way full backwards compatibility is ensured.

More technical details at :ref:`Version 2 API docs <tech-api-v2>`.


Transifex Client-0.5
====================

.. note::

    Main article at :ref:`Transifex Client-0.5 <user-client-05>`

Parallel to the release of Transifex-1.1, the release of the Transifex client
v0.5 took place. The gist of the new introduced features is:

New features
------------

* Introduced :ref:`local language mappings <user-client-05-mapping>`, allowing
  the push of arbitrary local files (eg. custom language codes) to remote,
  canonical languages (and also pulling) (added in version 0.5.1).
* The client can now pull the file with the translation in the source
  language as well with ``tx pull --source``.
* You can now specify the ``--skip`` option for the ``pull`` command
  so that the client does not stop on errors. This is useful when you want to
  pull many files from the server.
* The client uses now the HTTPS protocol by default for increased security.


Enhancements
------------

* Entries in configuration files are now sorted alphabetically. This way they
  don't change often, and when they do, they produce smaller diffs.
* The client now skips translations which have never been updated.
* The client is now more Windows-friendly.
* Support for Python stable release 2.4.
* Numerous bug fixes.

Bug Fixes
=========

A number of important bug-fixes have been incorporated into this release as
well. Many thanks go to our vibrant community for helping us point out and
implement them. Following is an overview of the fixes the Transifex 1.1 release
incorporates:

- Fixed a bug in jsonmap migrations under MySQL
- Fixed JSONMap slug field MySQL problem
- Fixed some issues with extended unicode characters in source strings
- Fixed a problem with Languages containing unicode characters in their name.
- Fixed a unicode issue in PO file metadata.
- Fixed auto-suggest and copy source actions for pluralized translation rows in
  Lotte.
- Removed unused dependency (Urlgrabber)
- Translation unique hashes are now calculated from the concatenation of the
  translation string and the context.
- Improved permissions checks and fixed some permission issues.
- Private teams are no longer visible in the user's public profile.
- Fixed encoding error with charts addon.
- Char overflow for resource slug from the API has been fixed.
- Fixed encode error with localized exception messages.
- Fixed feeds not printing correct chars.
- Fixed a bug which broke the default ordering of plurals in Qt, PO files
- Fixed a bug with PO files using logical ids.
- Fixed URL misleading what was resulting on 404 errors
  The issue was related to some slugs ending with 'p' that were
  mismatching the /p/ on the URLS. Includes of URLS should always have
  ^ in the beginning. So p/ as changed to ^p/ to avoid such problems.
- Fixed Lotte auto-save for plural fields
  Now whenever the auto-save is enabled, a plural entry will only be
  pushed whether all or None of the plural textareas where filled in,
  when the entry is modified, of cource.
- Changed Ajax resource action page URL to avoid cross-subdomain problems
- Fixed watches Ajax URLs to avoid cross-subdomain problems
- Uploading a new source file to Transifex now updates all the source entity
  fields with the new values (which means you can convert a non-pluralized
  source entity to a pluralized one etc)
- PO-Revision-Date now has the last update time of the language, not now().
- Fixed duplication of received email for some notifications.
- Obsolete entries are not imported in the Db.
- Fixed an issue with lotte and backslashed ('\n' and '\\n' were treated the
  same).

Getting Transifex 1.1
=====================

You can experience Transifex live at http://www.transifex.com/. This upstream
instance is hosted by Transifex, the company behind the development of Transifex.

Project and community managers who want to deploy Transifex for their 
own community may refer to the :ref:`Installation documentation <installing>`.


Upgrading to this version
=========================

To upgrade the code, update your package distribution as usual:

- If you installed from your package distribution, check if there's been a
  package upgrade and go for it.
- If you used ``easy_install``, run ``easy_install -U`` to upgrade.
- Fresh tarballs are available, if you installed from a release zipfile.
- Finally, if you're of the daredevil kind and feed straight from the source,
  ``git pull`` should do the trick for you.


Dependencies
------------

The following extra dependencies was *added* since the last major version:

- django-haystack >= 1.2
- pysolr

One dependency is *no longer* required starting from this version:

- urlgrabber

Instructions on how to install the dependencies can be found at the
:ref:`Installation docs <installing>`. You'll need to complete this step
before actually doing the database migration.



Migration
---------

Transifex 1.1 has undergone some changes in its database schema. However it's
very easy to migrate to the new database using the python commands included in
the main directory. To do this, you need to run::

    python manage.py syncdb --noinput
    python manage.py migrate --ignore-ghost-migrations --noinput


Then, you only need to create new notice types and new languages by executing
the following commands::

    python manage.py txcreatenoticetypes
    python manage.py txlanguages

Also, our new extra-powerful RLStats feature needs to be initialized
with the following command::

    python manage.py txstatsupdate

.. note::

    Depending on the size of the database and the number or projects and
    resources that you have, this process may take up to several hours.


Sample Migration
::::::::::::::::

A sample run for a migration from Transifex version 01.1 to Transifex 1.1
follows (all stdout/sterr output are omitted)::

    git clone git@github.com:transifex/transifex.git
    git checkout 1.1
    python manage.py syncdb --noinput
    python manage.py migrate --ignore-ghost-migrations --noinput
    python manage.py txcreatenoticetypes
    python manage.py txlanguages
    python manage.py txstatsupdate

.. note::

    Why the name 'Sabretooth'?
    
    Sabretooth (Victor Creed) is a fictional character, a Marvel Comics
    supervillain. The character first appeared in Iron Fist #14 (August 1977).
    Originally portrayed as a non-powered serial killer, Sabretooth is later
    written as a mutant who possesses bestial superhuman abilities, most
    notably a rapid healing factor, razor-sharp fangs and claws, and superhuman
    senses. He is a vicious assassin responsible for numerous deaths both as a
    paid mercenary and for his personal pleasure.

    Sabretooth has appeared in several X-Men animated series, movies and video
    games, just like all the codenames of our releases. The character Wolverine
    is depicted as his long-time enemy.

    All the above match perfectly with the characteristics of Transifex 1.1
    ifself. The best is yet to come.
