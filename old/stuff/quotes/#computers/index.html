<p>
	Πάντα μου άρεσαν τα quotes of wisdom και τα <acronym title="Message Of The Day">MOTD</acronym>. Έτσι σκέφτηκα να μαζέψω μερικά που έχω κρατήσει και να τα ρίξω εδώ. Ακολουθούν λοιπόν διάφορα quotes που κάποια από αυτά αντανακλούν τέλεια την πραγματικότητα και κάποια άλλα απλά προκαλούν γέλιο με την δόση ειρωνίας που τα χαρακτηρίζει.

<p><q>[John Milton as the Devil reffering to God] Let me give you a little inside information about God. God likes to watch. He's a prankster. Think about it. He gives man INSTINCTS! He gives you this extraordinary gift, and then what does He do, I swear for His own amusement, his own private, cosmic gag reel, He sets the rules in opposition. It's the goof of all time. Look but don't touch. Touch, but don't taste! Taste, don't swallow.</q> (<cite>The Devil's Advocate</cite>)

</p>

<p><q>We have only one thing to give up. Our dominion. We don't own the world. We're not kings yet. Not gods. Can we give that up? Too precious, all that control? Too tempting, being a god?</q> (<cite>Ethan Powell, Instinct</cite>)
</p>

</p>

<p><q>What came first, the music or the misery? People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos, that some sort of culture of violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?</q> (<cite>Rob, High fidelity</cite>)

Leonard, always the years between us, always the years, always the love, always...the hours...</q> (<cite>Virginia Woolf, The hours</cite>)

<p><q>A woman's whole life, in a single day, just one day, and then that day, her whole life.</q> (<cite>Virginia Woolf, The hours</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>Reform is a discarded fantasy.</q> (<cite>Javert, Miserables, Les</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed.</q> (<cite>Elle, Legally Blonde</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>I don't give a shit about sleeping, Leon. I want love, or death. That's it.</q> (<cite>Mathilda, Leon</cite>)

</p>

<p><q>All of this may be an elaborate simulation inside a device sitting on someone's desk.  -- Jean-Luc Picard,  ST:TNG, Ship in a Bottle</q> </p>

<p><q>Youth must go, ah yes.  But youth is only being in a way like it might be an animal.  No, it is not just like being an animal so much as being like one of these malenky toys you viddy being sold in the streets, like little chellovecks made out of tin and with a spring inside and then a winding handle on the outside and you wind it up grrr grrr grrr grrr and off it itties, like walking, O my brothers.  But it itties in a straight line and bands straight into things bang bang and it cannot help what it is doing. Being young is like being like one of these malenky machines.
-- Alex, A Clockwork Orange</q> </p>

<p><q>But the not-self cannot have the bad, meaning they of the government and the judges and the schools cannot allow the bad because they cannot allow the self.  And is not our modern history, my brothers, the story of brave malenky selves fighting these big machines?  I am serious with you, brothers, over this.  But what I do I do because I like to do.</q> (<cite>Alex, A Clockwork Orange</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>Alex's adventures are a kind of psychological myth.  Our subconscious finds release in Alex, just as it finds release in dreams.  It resents Alex being stifled and repressed by authority, however much our conscious mind recognizes the necessity of doing this.</q> (<cite>Stanley Kubrick</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>I know how things are now.  Nobody wants or loves me.  I've suffered and suffered and suffered and everybody wants me to go no suffering.  I know.</q> (<cite>Alex, A Clockwork Orange</cite>)

<p><q>TAINT_NOT;		/* Each statement is presumed innocent */</q> (<cite>From pp_nextstate in pp_hot.c, in the source for perl 5.6.0</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>Fortunately our postmodern culture is based on the happy contradiction that any decent culture must be countercultural. If you can't deconstruct your own program, you aren't really with the program.</q> (<cite>Larry Wall, "Uncultured Perl", <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/1999-10/uncultured_03.html">LINUX MAGAZINE</a>, October 1999</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>Issac Newton: Albert... So do you still believe that God doesn't play dice?
  Albert Einstein: That quote isn't *relative* anymore. Lately, I've been thinking that God doesn't play Pokemon.</q> (<cite>Nitrozac, <a href="http://www.geekculture.com/geekycomics/Aftery2k/y2Karchives/165.html">AFTER Y2K!</a>, 1 November 1999</cite>)

</p>

<p><q>I want to be part of a certain kind of community in which people have certain freedoms. Community and freedom are primary, not business. A software industry can be a good thing, as long as it develops free software; but if our choice is between having the community and having a software industry, we should keep the community.</q> (<cite>Richard M. Stallman, 10 August 1998</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>When I first encountered C, things were simple.  A number was a number, and
  a pointer was a pointer.  When I had studied it a while, it became much more
  complex, with many rules to memorize.  A number was a no longer a number, a
  pointer was no longer just a pointer.  Now that I understand C, it is simple
  again.  A number is a number.  A pointer is a pointer.</q> (<cite>The Zen of C</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>If I had a pointer big enough, I could move the world.</q> (<cite>(allegedly) Brain W. Kernighan</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>Quite frankly, I found it mostly interesting in a Jerry Springer kind of way. White trash battling it out in public, throwing chairs at each other. SCO crying about IBM's other women. ... Fairly entertaining</q> (<cite>Linus Torvalds, concerning SCO's lawsuit on IBM</cite>)
</p>

<p><q>They are smoking crack.</q> (<cite>Linus Torvalds, concerning SCO's lawsuit on IBM</cite>)
